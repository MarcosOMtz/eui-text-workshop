However, the growth in the number of employees sharing employment and other paid or unpaid interests expands the range and significance of working-time issues. This dissertation claims that where regulation and implementation of working-time transitions are favourable to part-time employment, part-time is likely to expand to more diverse categories of workers than those for whom it was originally intended ( i.e. mothers with caring responsibilities). The research follows a case-oriented comparative approach that draws on documentary information and a total of 48 in-depth interviews with actors&rsquo; representatives at three levels: national, sector (education and local government) and organizational, in the UK, the Netherlands and Spain. Initiated in different moments in time, the regulation of working-time transitions appears to follow a similar staged path in the three countries, although the wider institutional context affecting part-time and the active support of main actors varies for each country, especially at the organizational level. In the Dutch case, part-time regulation started off as a mechanism to enable the employment of women with caring responsibilities and, from there, it evolved towards a wider understanding of workingtime flexibility, extending the right to work part-time to other categories of employees. Given the pioneering role of the Netherlands in this area, it could be argued that both the UK and Spain have been following the Dutch example although with different degrees of success. In the Netherlands, after two decades of active support to part-time, there is still a big gender gap among part-timers, and in many sectors and occupations employees face difficulties to change their working hours; still, the general trend seems to be that access to part-time is becoming easier at more sector and occupational levels, in a context where organizations, already facing short full-time working weeks and high percentages of part-time, have been learning to decouple business hours from the different duration of the employees&rsquo; shifts. The need to design clear-cut coordination mechanisms that guarantee the steadiness of the service and the 'standardisation' of handing-over procedures, have helped to accept a variety of working-time arrangements. This capacity to dissociate organisations&rsquo; operative time from employees&rsquo; working hours is also present in British and Spanish 24-hour services, what has favoured exceptional good part-time jobs. However, the political efforts to promote part-time in Spain and the UK are confronted with serious obstacles, their segmented labour forces among them. The long-hours culture in both Spain and the UK, together with the high proportion of temporary contracts in the Spanish case, are the most visible signs of the structural difficulties these two countries face to achieve working-time flexi-curity. In the three countries, there are no clear links between long hours and productivity levels, and the processess that lead to more transparent assessments of work performance seem to facilitate working-time flexibility beyond standard full-time employment contracts. Certainly, different commitments and compromises need to be achieved between conflicting demands and interests about how employees use their own time, but this thesis argues that part-time may help to soften the conflicts between the specialization and hierarchy requirements of the social division of labour and individuals&rsquo; time-use autonomy."

The objectives are to examine the conditions under which regional nationalist parties have influenced the reform of state structures and to assess the factors that condition the relation between their electoral and policy success. The thrust of the argument advanced is that the influence of regional nationalist parties on the reform of state structures can be understood as the result of processes that take place during the agenda-setting and the decision-making phases. To provoke institutional change, regional nationalist parties must firstly set the political agenda by exerting pressures on mainstream parties in the electoral, parliamentary and governmental arenas. Secondly, institutional change is likely to occur, if nationality claims are accommodated by mainstream parties that are ideologically open to political decentralisation and the recognition of regional nationalism and if the question of territorial autonomy has a broader resonance for political competition between mainstream parties. Finally, institutional change is likely to occur, if the government undertaking reforms is cohesive and there is no ideological opposition by any partisan veto players to those reforms. These arguments are examined through a comparative-historical analysis of political decentralisation in Great Britain, Spain and Belgium, over a time period spanning the late 1960s to the late 1990s. Each case study is disaggregated into time periods that represent moments in the process of territorial restructuring, bounded by significant changes in the assertiveness of regional nationalist parties and the occurrence of territorial reform. Within each period, the process tying the claims of regional nationalist parties to institutional change is examined. Theses different observations are used as evidence for undertaking a comparison of the accommodation of nationalism across space and time. The thesis finds that regional nationalist parties exert a strong influence on the creation of decentralised state structures when they can set the political agenda. It is also necessary for nationality claims to be accommodated by mainstream parties that are open to the accommodation of nationalism and for them to feature as a salient issue of party competition, and for constitutional reforms to be undertaken by a cohesive centre-left government. The ideological opposition of a partisan veto player in government to institutional change is sufficient for bringing about the failure of reform. The second finding is that the configuration of factors producing reforms tends to diversify with the development of restructuring. During the empowerment of regional governments, regional nationalist parties can set the political agenda and their claims may feature as an issue of party competition, but the reforms must be undertaken by centre-left governments. The subsequent deepening of territorial autonomy is stimulated by regional nationalist demands but undertaken by governments of different ideological persuasions whose mainstream parties may compete on the territorial dimension."

Despite being one of the most affluent regions in the world, several episodes of nationalist violence arose from the late 1960s all over the continent. Faced with very strong states, these armed movements recurred to terrorist techniques of warfare to mobilize supporters and extract concessions from the goverment. However, some of the nationalist armed organizations succedded in building support and becoming resilient whereas many others failed and disappeared very quickly. In order to explain this variation, I contend that classical 'grievances' arguments must be complemented with 'mobilization' accounts of nationalist violence. Thus, the success of a terrorist nationalist organization in surviving does not only depend on the sources of grievance it can trigger in its fight against the state, but also on its capacity to create a large constituency of support that guarantees the steady flow of recruits, funds and legitimacy. In addition to grievances and 'mobilizational' incentives, this thesis also looks at the specific link between the political elites at the centre of the state and those holding offices at the regional level. If the dominant state-wide political forces also command the largest plurality of votes at the regional level, then state actors will have strong incentives to deal quickly with any nationalist challenge from the region under dispute. Regional politicians whose electoral fortunes depend on state-wide parties prefer reacting with some level of concessions if they expect the increase of nationalist mobilization in the absence of a positive state reaction. On the other hand, if regional politicians have autonomous sources of power - i.e., they do not run on state-wide party lists- state political actors will have more trouble in dealing with nationalist violence, since they must rely on the regional actors to assess the real demand for concessions. Whenever regional politicians are averse to change -because they anticipate that potential concessions will be paid by them-, they will advise state makers to repress nationalists. And if armed nationalists have potential to build their own constituency, state repression will contribute to that end. This combination of institutional 'unresponsiveness' and 'mobilizational' incentives can account for the existence of resilient armed nationalist organizations in Western Europe. I test this argument in two steps. First, I analyze a dataset with 30 observations of nationalist-prone European regions. The aim is to check whether the main argument fares empirically well in comparison to more standard explanations of nationalist violence. Second, I run three paired-wise comparisons to track in-depth the process of consolidation of nationalist violence. I compare the Basque Country, Corsica and Northern Ireland with Catalonia, Sardinia and Wales respectively. The main argument of the thesis works reasonably well to account for the observed variation, and it has also some implications for the potential emergence of armed nationalist movements in developing countries."

Why is this so? The dissertation takes a close look at privatisation policies in health care in Denmark, Sweden and England in order to figure out how and why the private health care sector has expanded rapidly in recent years. Health care services in Denmark, Sweden and England provide good examples of welfare state service privatisation because these three countries have spent decades building up universal public health care systems that offer free and equal access to all citizens - and these programmes are very popular. In this dissertation I find that the most common explanations for welfare state reform fail to explain these changes: Privatisation policies are not the result of partisan politics, instead they are supported by Social Democratic / Labour parties and in some cases the unions as well. Privatisation is not the result of pressures for fiscal retrenchment; in fact, public health care funding has increased in all three countries over the past decade. Neither is privatisation the straight forward result of new right wing ideas. Certainly, new ideas play a role in this change, but it is difficult to sustain the argument that ideas alone have been the cause of privatisation in these three health care systems. Finally, it has been debated whether privatisation is the result of pressure from EU legislation. This explanation does not hold either for the basic reason of timing. The policies leading to privatisation in Denmark, England and Sweden were all implemented before the European debate over health care services started. Instead, I suggest that privatisation in health care in Denmark, Sweden and England can best be understood as the product of policy makers puzzling over important policy problems (Heclo, 1972). I call this an adaptive process. In this analysis I show that privatisation is the result of several interconnected attempts to adapt health care systems to a changing context. By taking a long historical view of the changes in health care systems, it becomes evident that the changes towards privatisation do not occur overnight or as a result of a &lsquo;punctuated equilibrium&rsquo;. Rather, the increasing privatisation in health care is the accumulated effect of several small step policy changes, which, over time, result in rising levels of privatisation. Some scholars have suggested that neo-liberal policies, such as privatisation of service provision, will ultimately lead to the end of the welfare state. In this study, I come to a different conclusion. Rather than undermine the welfare state, privatisation in health care may help the welfare state survive. Privatisation can be seen as a way of adapting welfare state services to a changing political context."

This research, acknowledging the growing role played by political parties in the EU polity and their importance for its legitimization, addresses the following question: what impact has the mega-enlargement of the Union had upon the process of institutionalization of the Europarties and the EU party system? Theoretically, this work draws from the literature on party and party system institutionalization in the developing polities, and makes these concepts 'travel' to the European Union. More specifically, it identifies two main dimensions in the concept of party institutionalization: a 'structural' dimension, referring to party organizational consolidation, and a 'value' dimension, capturing the party value-system and ideology. By treating enlargement as an 'external shock', and relying on the literatures on partisan formation and development, three main propositions are then advanced. In sum, enlargement is expected to have a positive effect on the party structural dimension, but a more negative impact on the value dimension of institutionalization and on the competitiveness of the EU party system. Empirically, the validity of the above propositions is assessed by combining qualitative and quantitative research strategies. On the one hand, the impact of enlargement upon the Europarty organizations is evaluated through an analysis of their 'official stories' and by interviewing Europarty elites and administrators. On the other, its impact on the value dimension is tested by using descriptive and inferential techniques on different data: attitudinal and textual data (Euromanifestos and EU Profiler data) are combined with behavioural data (roll-call votes)."

This dissertation is an attempt to explain the cross-national variation of elderly care programs from the perspective of historical institutionalism. Specifically, it maintains that the statesociety relations structured by electoral rules and party system affect the development of elderly care programs. Since universalistic social policy, including public elderly care programs, faces collective action problems, it is less likely to thrive unless the state relatively autonomous from societal interests is able to coordinate its benefits and costs in an equitable way. And, then, to what extent the state retains its relative autonomy is contingent on the predominant mode of intra- and inter-party competition in each country. On the intra-party dimension, whereas personal-vote-oriented electoral rules create a decentralized party and clientalistic political competition through particularistic benefits, party-vote-oriented electoral rules generate a centralized party and party-based political competition. On the inter-party dimension, while a ruling coalition fragmented along various social cleavages promotes particularistic party competition, one-party dominance is capable of internalizing the benefits and expenses of social protection programs within its broader constituencies unless the dominant party itself is decentralized. Hence, this thesis claims that oneparty dominance under the party-vote-oriented electoral system allows the state to be autonomous from societal interests and expand public elderly care programs. To verify the above theoretical argument, this thesis conducts quantitative as well as qualitative analysis. Its quantitative analysis, using pooled cross-section and timeseries data of 15 OECD countries from 1980 until 2001, shows that electoral rules structure the process translating demographic changes into public spending for elderly care programs. Qualitative case studies, which cover Sweden, Japan, and the U.S., demonstrate that the state plays a critical role in developing and reforming public elderly care programs in these countries. Overall, this thesis concludes that although the effects of party system are inconclusive, the degree of state autonomy structured by electoral rules is an important determinant of public elderly care policy."

Parlamento -- Elections; Elections -- Italy","Questa tesi, che si colloca all'interno del filone di studi sul voto, costituisce il primo lavoro sistematico che cerca di rispondere all'interrogativo ""che idea hanno i politici degli elettori e del mercato elettorale?"". Mentre si sa molto su che cosa i cittadini pensano dei politici, dei partiti e del voto, pi&ugrave; raramente ci si &egrave; interrogati su che cosa i politici pensano degli elettori, una tematica interessante per almeno due ragioni. La prima &egrave; che i politici sono certamente attenti (e preoccupati?) a quanto avviene nel mercato elettorale: l'autonomia delle forze sociali, la ""nuova politica"", il calo della partecipazione, l'incremento della mobilit&agrave; elettorale, il successo dei ""partiti anti-partito"", la rilevanza dei mass media e della personalizzazione della politica, e cos&igrave; via.

Dopo avere discusso gli studi pi&ugrave; recenti sull'evoluzione delle democrazie contemporanee e dei principali attori del mercato elettorale (partiti ed elettori), questa ricerca analizza le risposte a un approfondito questionario inviato ai parlamentari italiani, che ha per oggetto i loro atteggiamenti rispetto a diverse tematiche: come sta cambiando la democrazia italiana con l'integrazione Europea? Perch&eacute; gli elettori sembrano incontentabili? Come resistere all'antipolitica? E' finita l'""et&agrave; dell'oro"" nei rapporti con i gruppi di interesse?

A Study of Central and Eastern European Activists' is a doctoral thesis that presents the development and the characteristic of the Global Justice Movement in Poland, the Czech Republic and in Hungary. Using tools and approaches derived mostly from anthropology this thesis is supposed to give an insight into the movement in Central and Eastern Europe, but it also relies on the tradition of sociology (in particular social movement studies) with some references to postsocialist and historical studies. Although far from being complete, it is one of the first comparative ethnographies of the movement and of the activists in the region. One of the main ways to explain the specificity of the movement in this part of the world is the existence of the postsocialist condition &ndash; a set of factors that have shaped the ways of organization of contentious politics. This thesis also attempts to analyze the movement from various perspectives by looking at its relations with the civil society, subcultures and countercultural milieus and with other actors of the global movement. At the core of the analysis are the repertoire of actions used in the region and the frames used to link local protests with more global struggles. In particular I was interested how do the social activists manage to deal with the notion of postsocialism and how do they adapt the frames derived from activism in other parts of the world to their own cases. I have tried to analyze these processes by looking at the practices of the activists in order to get a more realistic image of the movement, not biased by the self-imaginations of the activists."

A Franco-British comparison of the participation of Muslim activists in the Global Justice Movement","2010","PEACE, Timothy","Global Justice Movement; Anti-globalization movement; Social movements -- Europe; Muslims -- Europe; France -- Emigration and immigration; Great Britain -- Emigration and immigration","This thesis investigates how progressive social movements deal with religious pluralism and religious political activism by engaging in a cross-country comparison of Muslim activists and their participation within the movement against neo-liberal globalisation (also known as the Global Justice Movement). Taking the example of two nation states which have a similar post-colonial history of migration and settlement, Britain and France, the thesis seeks to explain why we observe such differences in the reactions of social movement leaders to the novel development of Muslim activism within the movement. Using concepts developed in the study of social movements; in particular political opportunity structures (POS) and framing processes, three main findings emerge. Firstly, religion itself is not an explanatory factor behind the involvement of Muslims in this movement, although it may be strategically employed to encourage others. Secondly, reactions to Muslim participation by social movement organisations can be largely attributed to the respective philosophies of integration in each nation state. Social movement leaders in Britain are keen to show how diverse their organisations are by encouraging Muslim participation. In France, such diversity is perceived as weakness because it challenges their collective identity. Counterintuitively, we find more French Muslims willing to participate in social movements despite hostility to their presence by others. This is due to a stronger tradition of mobilisation within the left. Thirdly, different biographical outcomes of activism by Muslim activists within the GJM can be accounted for due to external political opportunity strucutures. British Muslim activists went on to form an electoral alliance with the radical left because of favourable opportunity structures but their French counterparts failed to do the same because opportunities were closed."

It offers a multilevel, empirical investigation of employee working conditions and industrial relations comparing ID and non-ID firms. The study includes employers and employees in 78 firms. Three main work-related elements are examined. First, the antecedents of employees&rsquo; positive perception of unions and union membership are explored. Second, central aspects related to employee functional flexibility (i.e. changing tasks and positions within the firm) are investigated. Finally, elements determining the degree of employees&rsquo; positive evaluation of their job in terms of opportunities for learning and development and general contentment are investigated. All three elements are analysed by comparing ID/non-ID firms and Danish/Italian firms. Questions related to work in family firms are also raised. The findings reveal that employees in family firms to a lesser extent were members of unions and reported being less functionally flexible. Moreover, the number of family member employees in a firm was negatively related to employees&rsquo; positive job evaluation. A trend toward better social relations in ID firms is seen. Findings show a lower degree of functional flexibility exerted by ID employees, suggesting the importance of alternative flexibility types in ID firms. Important national differences are seen, possibly reflecting the different ways in which the textile and clothing sector has developed as well as a more longstanding Danish tradition of focusing on the improvement of employees&rsquo; psychosocial working conditions. Findings also indicate that the degree to which the ID industrial relations vary from the national industrial relations models is dissimilar for Herning-Ikast and Prato. In view of the findings of this thesis the generalisability, transferability and future of the phenomenon of industrial districts is discussed."

This project puts forth the argument that the relationship between armed groups and their supporters is of fundamental importance to how and where armed groups mobilise and the repertoire of contention they adopt. Making use of Malthaner's concept of ""constituency"" (2011a), the PKK's armed struggle from its foundation in the 1970s until 1999 will be analysed. The particular manner in which the PKK actively constructed and maintained extensive support networks across contrasting socio-spatial contexts ensured its ongoing legitimacy and the material resources necessary for its survival. Although a noted power disparity exists between armed and unarmed actors, the relationship between them is always characterised by degrees of reciprocal influence; influence that is often expressed in a variety of subtle and contextually specific fashions. The project will therefore examine the dialectic between the PKK and its communities of support and how this has evolved over time and space from rural Kurdistan to the urban centres of western Turkey, and consider how it has impacted on the nature of violence deployed by the PKK in the course of its insurgency."

The example used in the thesis is that extant studies on the recognition of religion in international affairs assume that religion is always already present and intelligible as a category of political thought and action. It continues to demonstrate how this tendency is inherent in the theory and practices of recognition more broadly. In forgoing study of the processes through which these agents and objects were differentiated and individuated in the first place, recognition cannot but contribute to their reification. Moving beyond this impasse in IR Theory, the thesis argues, requires a more finely attuned genealogical sensitivity when it comes to the question how entities of international politics become recognizable. This suggests that scholars dwell on the processes through which they are constituted and made intelligible, i.e. recognizable. This insight is illustrated with reference to how &ldquo;religion&rdquo; became internationally recognizable as a differentiable and politically relevant category in and through two distinct yet related historical processes: the partition of South Asia with the establishment of Pakistan and the foundation of the state of Israel in the wake of the demise of the British Empire. Both states were claimed, enacted and subsequently recognized along the lines of religious difference; Muslim/non-&shy;-Muslim in the case of Pakistan and Jew/non-&shy;-Jew in the case of Israel. By studying macro and micro processes through which religion became a differentiated, taken-&shy;-for-&shy;-granted juridical, cultural and political category the thesis shows the processes through which religion became recognizable and how this particular recognizable version of religion was reified through the international recognition thereof, that is, the recognition of these two states as a Muslim Homeland and a Jewish National Home. The thesis thus argues against the assumption that religion, in and of itself is a root cause in the establishment of these two states, a source of violence in the ongoing conflicts with their neighbors, or an instrument of peace. Rather it argues that religion was made recognizable and reified in a particular shape and meaning through the processes of the international recognition of the two post-&shy;-colonial states. Rather than looking to recognize the importance of religion in international affairs, the thesis investigates the multiple manners in which religion emerged as a politically salient point of reference according to which a changing international order took shape and along the lines of which new international agency was and is claimed and recognized."

My reflections on a number of propositions which it seems impossible to doubt from a moral standpoint lead me to the view that for a morally competent agent, some propositions are removed from doubt. In conceiving of justification as a response to doubt based on reasons, I follow Wittgenstein and those contemporary philosophers who defend what are called &lsquo;contextualist&rsquo; approaches. Given the close relationship between justification and doubt, the claim that some propositions are beyond reasonable doubt in moral practices implies that certain philosophical demands for justification make no sense. Like contextualists, I oppose both foundationalist and coherentist accounts of moral justification and moral knowledge. Unlike them, I argue that moral knowledge ultimately amounts to knowledge how. This practical knowledge involves cognitive as well as emotional capacities, which are developed through training. On the basis of my account of moral competence, I am able to reject the view that morality can be justified from an extra-moral standpoint. The &lsquo;why be moral question&rsquo; turns out to be one of those purely philosophical questions which lack a role in practice. Despite denying the availability of any practice-independent standards of moral truth and critique, my account allows for moral criticism and moral progress."

Arendt's notion of human existence as always necessary doing to the world rather than just being is read here from her understanding of man as beginning. It is argued that, as such, it uncovers the existentialist dimension of Arendt's work, by and large neglected in Arendtian literature, while also influencing Arendt's understanding of the political as working freedom out of necessity and taking up of existence. This ultimately constitutes the unexplored contribution by Arendt to contemporary ontology: If ontology if to overcome and move beyond its metaphysical roots, it must ask political questions as the fundamental philosophical questions since it concerns the being that is always necessarily (in) doing. This reading of Arendt's project is founded upon the parallels of her thought with Heidegger's work that proceeds in the same philosophical direction. In order to understand and develop the implications of Arendt's thinking of the political in that direction, the project engages with Arendt's work on the source of action, which is interpreted here as a conceptual effort to overcome the metaphysical dualism of world. Arendt's theory of mind is analysed in relation to two fundamental principles of action, plurality and freedom, in order to argue that none of the three mind faculties - thinking, willing, judging - can generate action. The theory is then expanded through reference to the fragments on imagination in Arendt's writing, elaborated and developed in dialogue with Heidegger's and Castoriadis' work on the concept of imagination. Developing the concept of originary imagination as the source of action from these intuitions in Arendt's thought, the project uncovers the ontological fundament of opposition of Arendt's work to Heidegger's philosophy and establishes the ground to assert that Arendt's work offers an opening to post-metaphysical philosophy. While Heidegger's project is arrested by the notion of Dasein as being-in-the-world, unable to transcend givenness of existence and finally affirming it, Arendt puts forth the notion of human existence as primarily being to the world, always bringing about the new and resisting the givenness. This notion of human existence suggests that the fundamental questions of ontology ought to be political questions, the questions of doing rather than being."

Post-national politics in Europe: political justification and critical deliberation","2008","WITTROCK, Jon","Political science","This thesis sets out from the problem of a perceived prescriptive incoherence between, on the one hand, the structures of liberal democracy and, on the other hand, an underlying ideal of the nation. It then moves on to specify that problem as pertaining to competing sources of fundamental political justification, and the author agrees with those defending some version of public reason. However, he asks: Does this really entail the formation, necessarily, of a secular polity? And, he answers: That depends on what we mean by &lsquo;secular&rsquo;; and so the thesis proceeds to include an analysis of the conceptual pair of religious/secular along the lines of later analytic philosophy, arguing that we have to understand these concepts in terms of their implied ideals and practices, and that we cannot expect to find an essential core uniting all of their uses. And as a consequence of the above considerations, the author argues in favour of translating some of the components found within religious traditions into a &lsquo;post-Christian&rsquo; context, in which they are liberated from their connections to predetermined doctrines and set frameworks of interpretation; but unlike many working in the Kantian tradition, he does not focus on an &lsquo;ethical&rsquo; or &lsquo;moral&rsquo; content, but rather on what has often been called an &lsquo;aesthetic&rsquo; one. This latter term, however, originally refers, simply, to perception, and the author introduces the concept of &lsquo;oscillation&rsquo; to describe a phenomenological movement which has been included, albeit not under that name, as an analytical figure by several of the most important critical thinkers of the 20th century, and proceeds to inquire into the possible consequences, prescriptively, of this line of reasoning, thereby sketching, in the end, three paths &lsquo;beyond Burgenland and Kakanien&rsquo; which he call, firstly, a &lsquo;comprehensive critique&rsquo;, secondly, a weak and thirdly a strong &lsquo;critical synthesis&rsquo;, respectively. Finally, he tries to outline the limits of his position and speculates on possible future developments."

Electoral fraud in third wave regimes, 1974-2009","2012","VAN HAM, Carolien",NA,"As the &ldquo;third wave&rdquo; of democratization spread across the globe after 1974, more and more citizens got a chance &ndash;often for the first time in their lives- to cast their vote in multi-party elections. Since then, the number of countries holding regular elections for executive and legislative offices has sharply increased: over 85% of the world&rsquo;s states now select their national leaders through elections. Unfortunately, the variety of elections has multiplied concomitantly, ranging from &ldquo;free and fair&rdquo; elections with genuine contestation between parties or candidates to &ldquo;fa&ccedil;ade&rdquo; elections that are marred by manipulation and fraud. In light of these empirical developments, research on the quality of elections is increasingly relevant. Not only as a way to clarify the fuzzy boundaries between regime types, particularly electoral autocracy and electoral democracy. But also, and more importantly, to understand the causes of variation in election quality as well as its consequences for the functioning of government and broader democratization processes in these polities. This thesis studies the quality of elections in 97 countries in Southern Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, the Former Soviet Union, Sub-Saharan Africa, South America and Central America from 1974 until 2009. Chapter 1 reviews the literature on democratization and elections and specifies the research questions addressed. Subsequently, chapter 2 proposes a definition of the quality of elections that is grounded both in academic work as well as international legal conventions on human and political rights, and introduces the data collected to &lsquo;measure&rsquo; election quality. The resulting database on electoral fraud in third wave regimes contains election quality scores for over 880 elections. Chapter 3 and 4 study variation in election quality across polities, attempting to explain why some new democracies manage to &ldquo;get their elections right&rdquo; while others do not. Chapter 5 and 6 ask the &ldquo;so what&rdquo; question by investigating the consequences of variation in election quality: do elections of higher quality generate more accountable and responsive governments? Finally, chapter 7 connects the findings in the earlier chapters by inquiring to what degree and how election quality affects broader democratization processes and concludes with suggestions for policy-making and further research."

It then considers how these influences have been manifest in practice since the late 1960s, analysing IR policy documents produced by the peak organizations of capital and labour and by governments and political parties. The discussion refers mainly to the British case, but some recent developments in Ireland are also considered. Pluralist IR theory is shown to have hindered the development of responses to neoliberal attacks on the principle of worker self-organization. It is argued that, at least on an abstract theoretical level, an adequate response would have been to accept that the success of enterprises represents a shared interest of employers and employees, and that bargaining should therefore be abandoned in favour of deliberative forms of joint decision-making. This logic is reflected to some extent in recent union policies, especially in Ireland. However, a more determined change of direction has been inhibited by the theoretical inheritance of pluralism, principally its implication that market forces are not objective and autonomous but are an expression of values and interests inimical to the socio-political aims of the labour movement. The second part of the thesis is devoted to demonstrating that this need not be the case. The argument is based on a critique and reconstruction of Habermas&rsquo; Theory of Communicative Action. It is shown that although the employment relationship is to some extent &lsquo;media-steered&rsquo;, communicative interaction between employer and employee &mdash; interaction based on consensually-defined and thereby valid norms &mdash; is nonetheless possible. This implies that workers can participate positively in the definition and redefinition of the economic and administrative systems of capitalist society without thereby necessarily validating the existing aims and values of capital. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the implications of this finding for the theory and practice of industrial relations and the future of trade unionism."

My hypothesis is that the liberal agenda has worsened internationalists blind spots &ndash; such as the separation between politics and economics - and hence has restricted their political imagination. The superficiality of post-Cold War liberalism reinforces the exclusion from the political agenda of issues connected to development - such as hunger, poverty and income distribution - and leads to outcomes that are the opposite of the professed goals of liberal internationalists, the enhancement of human rights and international peace and security. I argue through a multidimensional concept of power that the foundational assumptions of post-Cold War liberalism - derived from the broader discourse of 'globalization' - and theoretical pitfalls - including a narrow concept of law - cover up some manifestations of power by overlooking asymmetries generated by international institutions, structures and discursive practices. The political consequences of the liberal agenda are scrutinized through the analysis of three cases: the creation of the WTO, the economic crisis in Argentina (2000-2) and the breakup of Yugoslavia. Having unveiled the liberal agenda as status quo scholarship, in the sense that it ultimately reflects the interests of the most powerful countries, I propose the creation of a critical alternative centered on development. In the context of the emergence of new powers in world politics such as Brazil and India, which remain in the group of developing countries, the critical agenda addresses background powergenerated asymmetries that restrict the choice set of people, especially in the developing world, to lead a long and healthy life, according to decent living standards and informed by a proper level of education in an environment of peace and security."

Scholars of political behaviour have focused on the exceptional character of the radical voter, the pivotal role played by radical right parties in explaining the strategies of mainstream parties, and the prevalence of negative attitudes. The aim of this study is to transcend the analysis of a minority of the political spectrum, present only in a limited number of political systems, and instead to comparatively observe the impact of attitudes towards immigration on mainstream electoral competition in Europe on the basis of individual, party and system levels of variation. The thesis has three main findings. First, the issue of immigration has strong potential to affect mainstream voting in contemporary European political systems. Contrary to what is usually implied by the literature on the radical right, attitudes towards immigration have a stronger tendency to generate centripetal rather than centrifugal electoral dynamics. Second, the immigration issue can reshape the morphology of established party systems through two distinct mechanisms of electoral change. The first mechanism is through the mobilisation of existing party supporters, which takes place through voters' calculations of electoral utility in a refined attitudinal continuum, taking into account voters' own positions and those of the parties. Thus, from a spatial voting perspective, the immigration issue can only mobilise parties' core supporters, but cannot easily generate vote transfers between parties. The second mechanism operates in reverse, through acquiring non-identified voters through valence mechanisms of voting. Changes in established electoral boundaries can only take place through voters who are not currently attached to a party, and who are able to link their concern about immigration to parties' competence in dealing with the issue. Finally, the third main finding of the thesis is that not all attitudinal constructs have a behavioural effect. Coherent perceptions constrained by previous left-right individual political predispositions are more likely to have an influence. These perceptions tend to focus on immigrant's adaptability to and compatibility with the host country. By contrast, perceptions framed in terms of superiority or inferiority of immigration vis-&agrave;-vis the host society are less likely to be translated into electoral outcomes."

During this period, European governments moved the institutional forum of cooperation from a transatlantic to a European context, extended joint activities to new areas, and established several organizations. Moreover, some of the largest defense companies merged cross-border, and the European Commission started playing an increasing role. The scholarly literature explains these new patterns of cooperation as a result of economic pressures but fails to account for the uneven effects of industrial consolidation, the irregular dynamic of cooperation, the partly overlapping responsibilities of the organizations, and leaves little room for political agency. The thesis conceptualizes armaments cooperation as a setting of a particular probl&eacute;matique and a related regime. It argues that a specific regime configuration corresponds to a certain understanding of the problem at hand, the political project at stake, and a perspective that aligns the joint activities. In 1992 and 1998, different groups of governments conceived of different problems that ought to be solved through cooperation. Hence, the regime was divided into separate arenas inside and outside the EU, in which joint activities were pursued with different purposes, leading to different degrees of integration, and the establishment of partly competing organizations. In 2005, all European governments accepted a link of the problems solved through armaments cooperation to the political project of establishing the EU as an international actor. They agreed that the purpose of cooperation was to provide the necessary military and technological capabilities. Consequently, cooperation was pursued in an increasingly integrated EU arena, inspired by a capabilities perspective, and supported by international organizations like the European Defence Agency and the Commission. Political leadership, timing, and concept crafting are identified as three aspects that are critical for shifts of the probl&eacute;matique. The thesis develops a theory neither of armaments cooperation nor of these cognitive shifts but stresses instead that political phenomena should be made intelligible, with reference to the context and time bound understandings of political actors."

After all, this was a region studied for its sturdy resistance to pressures for democratization. Scholars who had predominantly been occupied with understanding the unusual stability of Middle Eastern autocracies suddenly found themselves in need to explain the opposite &ndash; their unexpected vulnerability in the face of popular resistance. Their theories it seemed, were ill equipped for the task. Emerging out of the democratization-focused transitions literature, authoritarianism studies had in recent years departed from asking how institutions could push along democratization, to focus instead on how even seemingly democratic institutions could provide authoritarian regimes with stability and longevity. Their analysis thus heavily leaned on understanding elite coalitions and the institutions &ndash; formal or informal &ndash; that ensured regime maintenance. When scholars tried to understand the role of political opposition forces under authoritarian rule, it was mostly in the framework of either their lack of role or their (unwilling) support of authoritarian rule. The masses over which these regimes ruled, however, only rarely put in an appearance. It does therefore not come as a surprise that authoritarianism studies should have missed the widespread grievances brewing within Middle Eastern societies."

Starting from a descriptive section depicting coordination in a broad selection of member states, France, Germany, the UK, Spain, Denmark, Slovakia, and Poland, and their MEPs, the questions are posed: 1) Why do EU member states' governments coordinate with their MEPs in the EU legislative process? 2) Why does coordination vary between the member state governments? 3) How do MEPs perceive and receive the coordination efforts by the governments? The project assesses the extent to which the efforts by the national governments to coordinate with the MEPs are a direct function of the institutional changes to the EU legislative process that have shifted the balance of power between the Council and the European Parliament. The project then proceeds to seek out the main factors influencing the extent and mode of coordination between the actors, and the reasons member states differ in their approach to coordination. The analysis focuses, in particular, on the sizes and political systems of the member states, as well as on the duration of their EU membership. Finally, MEPs' receptiveness to coordination is investigated, and the effect of national and political affiliation on MEPs' openness to the input they receive from the national governments is analyzed. Through a qualitative analysis of empirical data gathered from semi-structured interviews with government officials, MEPs and MEP assistants from the selected countries, the project finds that while governments have reacted to the increased relative influence of the European Parliament by seeking to influence legislative negotiations via the MEPs, the development, in several countries, has been less than linear. The duration of states' EU membership and the overall amount of resources the governments allocate to influencing EU negotiations are among the main factors found to affect the governments' level of coordination. The political system of the member states is fund to have little influence on the extent or manner of coordination efforts by the governments. In general, MEPs have a positive view of engaging with, and receiving, input of both a political and technical nature from the governments. This positive view largely cuts across the domestic party political divide and, albeit to a lesser extent, across national lines. It is even found that, among some MEPs, an increased effort by the national governments to engage bilaterally with the MEPs, simultaneously with the formal legislative negotiations between the Council and the European Parliament, would be welcomed."

It starts out by presenting the core of the preconceptions with which I started my research, represented by reconstructions of three perspectives that were highly popular and influential in the financial globalization debate at the end of the 1980s and during the 1990s. Next, well-substantiated, systematized, and synthesized empirical and theoretical material from many different sources is presented with which the three perspectives are compared. On the basis of the findings, the study concludes that the three perspectives cannot reasonably be upheld. More generally, the study indicates different sources of causality that more or less contradict each other and that lead to some kind of transformation. The main channels through which financial globalization is hypothesized to impact on management practices are the possibility of offshore outsourcing, financial deregulation, foreign shareholdings, the way attempts to improve global competitiveness have been affected by international finance, and management practices of MNCs. The pressures resulting from financial globalization are interpreted to be to some extent resisted by domestic power constellations, while for many changes the relation to financial globalization is unclear. In all three countries, a number of &lsquo;neo-liberal&rsquo; practices has become more common. But some cultural adaptation appears to have occurred, while certain practices may already have been common in Japan and Germany. In addition, elements of Japanese management have been introduced in the US and Germany while universal banking has been introduced in the US and Japan. For management practices of MNCs, a mixture of home- and host-country practices is found together with some cultural adaptation. A case study of management practices in Japanese MNCs in the US also finds a mixture of home- and host-country practices."

While the EU was focused largely on its internal market from the mid-1980s onwards, external trade strategy became a key item on the agenda a decade later, wrapped in a more aggressive and free-market stance. I argue that the European Commission rather than the EU member-states was the key player in the decade that followed the signature of the Uruguay Round, and introduced services into trade negotiations. More precisely, based on empirical data from the years when Leon Brittan (1994-1999) and Pascal Lamy (1999-2004) presided as EU Trade Commissioners, the thesis analyses the European Commission&rsquo;s central role as a skilful &lsquo;network creator&rsquo; both in pushing for, and legitimising, an expansion of the free-trade agenda from goods to services. However, this research also argues that the Commission did not act alone, and that different kinds of non-state actors must also be analysed in order to understand changing EU trade governance at the dawn of the 21st century."

The cases under examination are Hungary and Poland which have experienced a similar historical background, similar environmental problems and have been subject to similar EU conditions and requirements for accession. Nevertheless, the EU Annual Progress Reports and the Tri-Annual Monitoring Reports showed a variation in their compliance with European environmental requirements. The existing literature has explained this divergence by taking a supply-side approach, focusing on those state actors and incumbents who could decide to supply compliance or not. In particular, researchers of compliance and of Europeanisation have focused on differences in capacity limitations or incentives to domestic actors. These supply-side approaches, however, do not seem to fully explain the existing divergence between the performances of Hungary and Poland nor do they sufficiently tackle the issue of ""sustainable compliance"" in the post-Accession period. In my analysis, I instead explain variation in sustainable compliance by exploring demand-side explanations. To this end, the thesis explores the hypothesis of demand for compliance emerging on the part of stakeholders who recognise its potential for profitability and, thus, influence its sustainability. Its starting point is the Tsebelis' study on stakeholders which describes them solely as ""veto players"" along the road to compliance; however, this analysis demonstrates that there is also another dimension to the influence they may have. I build my hypothesis around the existence of such factors as market incentives and pre-existing cooperative strategies that make compliance convenient for stakeholders. Moreover, I consider the role played by external assistance and the existence of alliances between external and domestic stakeholders to improve the overall compliance performance of less-regulated countries. The study proves the significance of market incentives and pre-existing cooperative strategies in fostering sustainable compliance while showing how the two strong explanatory variables are interlinked: compliance is not a ""business"" per se. It has a potential to be made a ""good deal"" via cooperative strategies among diverse stakeholders creating a win-win settlement."

The interaction of these factors, which I have decided to label as &ldquo;Tris Syndrome&rdquo;, is fundamental pillar of this analysis. In this respect, this work investigates how the answer to one of these new risks namely, care for the elderly, has evolved in Spain within the context of the evolution of the Spanish welfare state and noteworthy transformations of the territorial structure of the country since the beginning of the democratic period (mid-70&rsquo;s) to present. More precisely, this work poses the following questions: What factors have motivated change in the Spanish system of social services for the elderly, in the face of the apparent lack of mobilisation or demand from risk-bearers? What spurred the system to undertake radical reform following the authoritarian downturn, despite the fact that it is only very recently that care for the elderly has started to be defined as a challenge, and has taken a visible, but though timid, place on the political agenda? What have been the factors that have given voice to this &ldquo;silent&rdquo; demand? Why, despite the reforms undertaken, does the Spanish system of social (care) services for the elderly show comparatively little development in comparison with other countries and other areas of the Spanish welfare state? In relation to these issues, this thesis argues that the &ldquo;Tris&rdquo; has provided in Spain a scenario in which policy development has been simultaneously facilitated and constrained. It is thus possible to claim that the main push for welfare development in the real of policy under scrutiny and the answer to related new social risks (i.e. dependency), has mainly been a consequence of the will of regional political elites to mark out spaces of power, to achieve political and policy consolidation, not to lag behind others, and to solve institutional or structural problems in the area under regulation. These changes have taken place independently of the recognition of new social risks by policy-makers. In addition, when considering why this system and coverage among the population remains poorly developed, it is possible to signal the constraints posed by institutional factors and the strong influence that past policies have had on their development."

In contrast to previous research on migrant care work, this study incorporates both private and agency-based employment in child and elderly care. It applies a comparative case study approach relying on micro level survey data, expert interviews, policy documents, newspaper articles and secondary sources. Theoretically the research engages with welfare regime theory and with theories on the politics of migration and the politics of the welfare state. The demand for migrant workers in social care is strongest in elderly care. Cross country differences are related to variation in employment conditions. Migrant workers are overrepresented when social care jobs are badly paid, offer limited career opportunities and require extensive shift work. These employment conditions are significantly shaped by social care policies. It is argued that a Familialistic care regime, as demonstrated by the Italian case, fosters the emergence of a &lsquo;migrant in the family&rsquo; model of employment. A Liberal care regime, as revealed by the UK case, induces a &lsquo;migrant in the market&rsquo; model. By contrast, a Social Democratic care regime, as approximated by the case of Dutch elderly care, does not create any particular demand for migrant workers in the social care sector. Differences in care regimes influenced Italian, British and Dutch migration and care policies divergently. In Italy the presence of private migrant care workers absolved the state from reforming its social care system and meanwhile relatively generous migration policies for migrant care workers were enacted. In the Netherlands strong stakeholders guaranteed continuous investments in employment conditions of the elderly care workforce and migration policies have not granted any privileges to care workers. UK immigration policy reform has tightened eligibility criteria for care workers; nonetheless, it is questionable whether public investments in elderly care are sufficient to attract enough native employees."

EU and US reactions to Human Rights violations (1989-2000)","2001","HAZELZET, Hadewych","Human rights -- European Union; Human rights -- United States; Sanctions (International law) -- European Union countries","The dissertation shows that countries with severe human rights violations and/or dictatorships are likely to be subjected to sanctions, irrespective of their strategic or economic importance to the West. A considerable number of states are never sanctioned for violating human rights, but these countries tend to be liberal democracies, allies and at peace. I found that the differences between the E.U. and the U.S. are negligible with respect to the use of punitive measures, but striking when it comes to the use of positive measures. The E.U. uses a combination of &ldquo;carrots&rdquo; and &ldquo;sticks&rdquo;, while &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; essentially means free trade and little else for the U.S. I argue that the institutional set up of the E.U. and the U.S. political systems can largely account for the differences in their reactions, while their common adherence to liberal norms can account for the similarities. Historically and institutionally speaking, it is easier for the E.U. to decide on positive measures than on negative measures. The institutional set up of U.S. sanctions policy, in contrast, favors the use of sticks, given the role of Congress in the decision-making and the small constituencies which favor positive measures. The findings, which largely undermine Realism and support Liberalism and Constructivism, challenge the conventional wisdom in the field, both among scholars and in the wider policy world according to which Western states pursue rather inconsistent human rights policies."

There is, however, a strain of thought pre-dominant in political theory since the nineteenth century that doubts the capacity of political systems constituted by multiple public spheres to have sustainable democratic systems. This view is referred to here as the lingua franca thesis on sustainable democratic systems (LFT). It states that, in the absence of a common language for political debate, democracy cannot function well in the long-term as citizens existing in distinctive public spheres will inevitably come to have diverging preferences that cannot be satisfactorily resolved by a collective democratic process. Poor quality democratic institutions, as well as acute demands to divide the political system (through devolution or secession) so that state and society become more congruent, are predicted by this thesis. To arrive at a model of democratic legitimacy for the EU, in light of the challenge presented by the LFT, three major steps are taken. Part One attempts to arrive at an account of democratic legitimacy as a realistic ideal for modern political systems. Understanding democracy as a system which strives to maximise citizens&rsquo; equal opportunities for control over the decisions to which they are subject, the maximisation of electoral and direct voting opportunities for citizens is recommended, subject to certain practical constraints. Importantly, democratically legitimate institutions are identified as having important external effects, which amount to more than just the peaceful resolution of conflict. Centripetal democracy is the idea that legitimate democratic institutions set in motion forms of citizen practice and representative behaviour that serve as powerful drivers of demos-formation. In the second part of this dissertation, an effort is made to both classify and normatively assess the EU. As a political system the EU is taken to be a demoi-cracy, or a democracy of democracies, whereby the demoi of the member states take sovereign precedence over the European demos constituting the citizens of Europe as a whole. While citizen&rsquo;s control over their respective governments&rsquo; roles in EU decision-making is seen to have significant shortfalls, the major democratic deficiencies are detected in citizens&rsquo; control over actors located exclusively at the European level. Overall, the absence of voting opportunities directly connecting citizens to European power ensures that the EU is not controlled by its citizens in a way that is commensurate with the power it wields. If the EU is to democratise, it must be capable of dealing with the dynamics predicted by the LFT. Part Three of this dissertation analyses the sustainability of democracy in two political systems that bear striking resemblances to the EU, namely Belgium and Switzerland. Like the EU, these are multilevel and multilingual political systems attempting to organise themselves in a democratic fashion. Belgium proves to be a near perfect case for corroborating the LFT, its linguistic communities finding it increasingly difficult to coexist in one democratic community. Switzerland, by contrast, has managed to produce one of the most democratically legitimate political systems in the modern world, despite being fractured into linguistically distinct public spheres. As my conception of centripetal democracy predicts, however, the Swiss success in integrating the public spheres within one political system is in no small part related to the arrangement of its democratic institutions. That being said, there are certain conditions that made the development of centrifugal forces more likely and centripetal democracy less likely in Belgium than in Switzerland. In Part Four, where I finally derive a model of democratic legitimacy for the EU, it is demonstrated that while many of the conditions that made centrifugal forces so strong in Belgium are not (or not yet) present in the EU, the conditions for the development of a legitimate democratic process are also generally lacking. This is especially true when it comes to the introduction of direct democracy at Union level, although there may be fewer obstacles to making European institutions more electorally accountable."

As the cases of democratic Brazil, Spain and South Africa show, there is no straightforward answer to this question. As the power of politicians in a federation can be periodically changed, in democratizing federations such as Brazil (1988-2002), Spain (1979-2004), and South Africa (1994-2007) subnational politicians have been constantly bargaining to increase their autonomy vis-&agrave;-vis national politicians through a process of federalization and decentralization. In the light of these processes, I explain how and why the locus of authority has changed after a democratic constitutional pact has been reached between national and subnational political elites in the three cases. In the comparison, I observe that in democratizing countries where decentralization and federalization (independent variable) unfold under a bargained interaction between levels of government, the subnational political actors can gain institutional and policy autonomy (dependent variable) to shift the balance of power to the subnational levels (e.g. municipalities and states/provinces). In building a causal chain of events that explains changes in the intergovernmental balance of power, I show how and why decentralization-cumfederalization leads to de facto subnational autonomy in Brazil, Spain and South Africa. This research suggests that when changes in the intergovernmental dynamics occurred in Brazil, Spain, and South Africa, they were mainly endogenously generated by a mechanism that has reinforced over time the prevailing interest of subnational political elites reached at the time of the all-encompassing constitutions. The research findings indicate that despite the variations in the strategies of intergovernmental actors to shift the intergovernmental balance of power, the subnational interests have prevailed most of the time through decentralization and federalization processes. In all three cases intergovernmental relations changed from a centralized to a more dispersed distribution of authority, and from an imposed form of cooperation to a more bargained one. In order to search for external validation, I compare the abovementioned findings against the experiences of three additional countries &mdash;India, Malaysia and Mexico. These countries have shown that, despite being federations, intergovernmental bargaining has been limited and the processes of decentralization and federalization have been undermined by national political elites. This case-oriented research accomplishes the following goals: theoretically, it proposes a model that explains change and shifts of intergovernmental balance of power across countries; and, empirically, it presents the conditions under which intergovernmental balance of power can be changed."

Much scholarly work has thus focused on the study of changes in election results in order to understand the causes of this apparent increase. In doing so, volatility has been usually associated with voter instability, but the individual-level mechanisms of electoral change have been subject to very scarce research. This thesis is an attempt to shed more light on this providing a comparative account with data from dozens of elections in six Western European countries. It  rst investigates how and to what extent di erent types of behavior translate into changes in election results. Findings show that most of the volatility is caused by the action of switching voters. Due to the presence of canceling out, the relationship between the proportion of switchers and volatility is, however, far from perfect, although it can be approximated by introducing some of the variables that intervene in the translation of switching into net change. The second part of the thesis focuses on vote-switching and provides two main  ndings. First, inertia molds voters' preferences and impacts on their future behavior, which explains why most of the switching that takes place in elections is produced by young adults. Second, variations in the number of switchers across elections tend to be caused by the impact of short-term factors in the form of cyclical peaks. These peaks are usually followed by subsequent periods of stability. Sometimes, however, volatility produces changes in the terms of competition and generates a new equilibrium in the number of switchers at subsequent elections. This seems to be the reason why Western European voters appear more unstable in recent decades."

Since then, the total number of electoral reforms enacted in countries that select their rulers through free and fair elections has sharply increased: in the last two decades over 33% of the world's democratic states modified the formula employed for choosing the members of their national legislatures, and a similar percentage adjusted other elements of the rules of the game such as the district magnitude, the legal threshold, the assembly size or the ballot structure. Unfortunately, the academic examination of the causes and consequences of these episodes of institutional change has lagged well behind these empirical developments with single case studies and small n studies still the norm. In light of this gap, research on the determinants and the outcomes of electoral reform processes is increasingly needed. The aim of this study is to transcend the analysis of a small number of cases, and instead to comparatively examine the universe of electoral system changes that have occurred in 60 contemporary democracies between 1945 and 2010. The thesis has three main findings. First, the levels of party system fragmentation and citizens' satisfaction with democracy have strong potential to explain electoral system changes in contemporary democracies. Contrary to what is usually implied by the literature on electoral reform, parties are seen to have strong tendencies to pass restrictive rather than permissive electoral system changes in circumstances where the electoral system might be considered to be already overly-permissive resulting in excessive numbers of parties. Moreover, electoral reforms in the intraparty dimension usually take place when large numbers of voters are currently dissatisfied with the way democracy works in their country. The second main finding is that electoral reforms can reshape the morphology of established party systems through two distinct mechanisms of electoral engineering. The first mechanism takes place at the interparty level, with permissive reforms reducing the difference between the percentage of votes received and the percentage of seats obtained by a party, and restrictive reforms enlarging this gap. The second mechanism operates at the intraparty level, where candidate-centred reforms decrease the level of party system nationalization while partycentred reforms leave party system nationalization unchanged. Finally, the third main finding of the thesis is that parties' positions regarding the possible modification of the rules of the game have an electoral effect. Parties that advocate a permissive reform in countries with low party system fragmentation are more likely to electorally benefit. By contrast, support for such reforms when the number of parties is large is more likely to result in electoral loses."

The primary analysis revolves around several international campaigns carried out by coalitions of NGOs and other civil society organizations in the field of human security. Each empirical chapter examines the process towards the signature of a treaty largely from the activists&rsquo; perspective intertwined with diplomats and UN officials' views. The identification of pathways and determinants of successes and failures in these processes forms the central part of the analysis. The cases of study are the Coalition to Stop the Use and Recruitment of Child Soldiers, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, the International Action Network against the proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons, and the Coalition to stop Cluster Munitions. The strategic and organizational levels of these networks are examined through their roles in each international negotiation context, such as the Conference of Disarmament, the Convention of Certain Weapons of the UN Program of Action of Small Arms or the Oslo Process on Cluster Munitions. From this perspective, different successes can take place in terms of the access to the institutions and the procedures of the bargaining processes, in the setting of the (political and media) agenda and in the legal and policy-making dimension. In the long term, the model also considers the existence of cultural effects. The assessment of these effects is carried out mainly from a qualitative point of view. In the thesis, there are three cases that are successful (that result in a treaty) and one unsuccessful case (small arms), although each of them has a different degree of success in different dimensions, ensuring therefore the variability of the dependent(s) variable(s). This analysis in turn raises many more themes and inevitably a great host of questions. Among these is an investigation of a common pattern of evolution of a transnational coalition through three phases: the creation of the coalition, the negotiation of the treaty and its implementation. The lessons of these campaigns suggest that civil society organizations can be politically influent under a set of conditions, including flexible rules of the game (e.g. voting by majority and participatory channels) and a solid and credible leadership by allied countries willing to spend resources and organization in an issue that has humanitarian effects. Moreover, the most effective coalitions know how to better use the different contexts favourable to collective action, and also how to combine their resources (research, experience, grass-roots membership and the media), strategies (protest and political pressure, but also communicative processes, such as framing the problem and shaming the irresponsible governments), a flexible organization and the capacities of their international allies. Sometimes also, external events, such as changes in a government, terrorist attacks or economic crisis can play a role in these processes."

The locus of the study is the migration of Poles to the UK and Italy as countries that successively opened their labour markets for citizens of New Member States after the EU enlargement of 2004. I argue that i) international mobility may serve not only as a barrier but also as an enhancement for parenthood, and ii) placing one's family in the host country produces more durable and numerous ties than employment alone and favours settlement. In the case of Polish families, migration to the UK was a way of securing more stable and comfortable conditions, through salaries and benefits more adequate to family needs. It improved their experienced quality of life, allowed them to fulfill their desired fertility, and offered better prospects for the future. In families of Poles living in Italy the perception of welfare conditions was not that favourable, however it also offered long-term stability to the ones who had been struggling to survive in Poland. Long-term settlement emerged there due to the path dependency, especially the mechanism of &bdquo;tied stayer"". The perspectives on settlement differed according to age at migration and stage of life (stable partnership, children's age, ageing parents' needs). On the theoretical level, the project combines sociology of migration, perspectives on intergenerational relations and life course research. The thesis contributes to the research on intra-EU migrants with a wide range of socio-economic statuses by presenting their perception of migratory trajectories and plans for the future from a family-oriented perspective."

This general conclusion is reached in numerous steps. First, an uncontroversial form of prima facie pluralism is accepted as the point of departure. Second, the diversity of value conflicts as well as the variety of different relations that values can have to each other (the degree of comparability) is established. Third, the impact of representations and the importance of the selection of matter for reasoning are illustrated and named the problem with representation. This, fourthly, undermines the possibilities of monistic value theories to dissolve conflicts, but also means that explanatory models of values need to account for both currencies of values and the way in which representations of the world are created. Such types of explanatory models are dubbed explanatory pluralism. Once the problem with representation and need for explanatory pluralism are settled, it is shown that prevalent approaches to decision-making (including maximizing methods, subsumption under principles, and by Aristotle inspired approaches that assign importance to judgment) have some merit, but all fail to account for the complexities surrounding what it is like to make a choice in a value conflict. The only way of dealing with these complexities is by combining a plurality of first order methods so that these can be matched with particular situations with the assistance of interpretative and creative reasoning. A unified approach to decision-making that furthermore accepts the necessity of its procedural nature as well as the dialectical relation between holding a value and making a decision manages best to deal with the identified problems."

How did the formation of the 'German model' become possible in the face of employers&rsquo; structural power? The thesis confronts two alternative theoretical approaches for explaining employers&rsquo; acceptance of market-correcting institutions: an economic-functionalist approach ('crossclass coalition thesis') and a political-strategic approach ('political accommodation thesis'). The first one focuses on economic benefits derived by specific types of firms from welfare state and industrial relations institutions, the second on political constraints and changes in the political power structure, and employers&rsquo; strategic responses to them. The thesis finds that the political accommodation thesis has greater explanatory power and challenges business interest-based explanations of welfare state development. The empirical analysis in the thesis traces the preferences (interest perceptions), strategic considerations, and resulting policy positions of the national employer federations in Germany during three different political regimes: the Wilhelmine Empire (1871-1918), the inter-war Weimar Republic (1918-1933), and the post-war Federal Republic (1949-1990s). The analysis focuses on those historical reform events that, in retrospect, came to shape welfare state and industrial relations institutions in Germany. Process analysis based on historical sources and diachronic comparison are used as methods to reconstruct (i) the motivations of employers for supporting or opposing specific policy options, and (ii) the socio-political and institutional environment within which employers formed their preferences and strategies. The thesis studies Germany as a crucial case study because of the paradigmatic character of this country as a type of non-liberal capitalism that is often understood to benefit certain types of firms today. Empirically, the thesis finds that socio-political and institutional constraints motivated employers to accept specific policies and institutions, rather than hard-wired economic interests. The thesis identifies two dominant employer strategies in welfare state politics: (a) pacification of radicalized elements within labor, and (b) containment of expansionary reform projects. Moreover, the thesis finds that employers consistently preferred conservative types of social policies to universalist (social democratic) alternatives, and explains this as a result of differential impacts on work incentives. The deliberate formation of cross-class coalitions is found to have been rare and to have happened only under conditions of extraordinary political and economic uncertainty. Issues of skill formation are found to have played a marginal role."

Such information helps voters to choose parties and candidates which are likely to promote their interests in political decision-making. However, it is well established that many people often fail to become adequately informed about politics due to a lack of political interest and cognitive abilities. It is, furthermore, broadly acknowledged that our impression formation is to a considerable degree guided by affect and particularly by our party identity, which can severely bias our perceptions of parties&rsquo; policy standpoints and their responsibilities. This dissertation investigates how our impression of what political parties stand for in the left-right spectrum as well as in the conflict over European integration is determined by voters' level of cognitive resources and by their party attitudes. In addition, what people might know inevitably depends on the information environment, which is largely shaped by political parties&rsquo; behavior; our knowledge about politics depends on the quantity and quality of policy-relevant information disseminated by political parties. I discern between three policy-based strategies of party competition: 1) position-taking; 2) the manipulation of salience; and, 3) a politics of ambiguity. By employing these policy-based strategies parties create information that is crucial for representation. Thus, public knowledge about political parties is the outcome of a communicative process between voters and political parties. It depends on voters' cognitive and affective components as well as on the policy-based strategies of competition employed by political parties. Moreover, I explore how cognition and party affect are associated with party knowledge conditional upon the information environment as shaped by political parties."

My point of departure is the puzzling observation that, in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, a quite large number of countries practiced ius domicilii and unconditional ius soli as the most important principles of citizenship acquisition, against a growing number of states following the 1804 French Civil Code which reinvented ius sanguinis. In less than one hundred years however, ius sanguinis became the most important principle of citizenship acquisition all over the world, ius soli was largely restricted, and ius domicilii almost disappeared. My intention is not to investigate this historical process, but to explore the ways in which normative theories and academic research in immigration studies may reveal the need to re-evaluate a residence-based citizenship theory based on ius domicilii. In this sense I am analysing four test cases which have in common the essential fact underlined by Joseph Carens that in time immigrants become members of society, irrespective of political authorities&rsquo; decisions. This is enough to substantiate a claim to citizenship. The test cases are irregular migrants, temporary workers, dual citizens and 'external quasi-citizens.&rsquo; I argue that the 'undocumented&rsquo; have a moral claim to regularisation after one year of illegal residence, and further that the first two categories of migrants have a moral claim to citizenship acquisition after three years of legal residence, which is the threshold supported today by a few liberal states. But if residence supports a claim to citizenship, then lack of it for an extended period sanctions loss of this status. Thus I argue against dual citizenship, trying to explain that its advantages are either rather imagined than real, or they can be achieved through more convenient means. However, in order to acknowledge the fact that many people have real and strong ties to more than one country I suggest the status of 'external quasi-citizenship&rsquo; which may be accessed by non-residents and may provide numerous entitlements, possible all citizenship rights except the right to vote and the right to stand for elections. I also analyse legal provisions in fifty states and try to make a normative plea for residence-based citizenship. In a final step, I discuss four alternative theories of citizenship which do not easily come to terms with the idea of residence-based membership and try to make a case for the latter."

Firstly, the recent renaissance and subsequent expansion of thought and discussion about civil society have been accompanied by a noteworthy lack of conceptual and terminological clarity. A high degree of eclecticism prevails, with contributors choosing arguments and definitions commensurate with their own ideological, disciplinary and cultural positions but ignorant of the full conceptual wealth and development of civil society through history. Therefore, the first part of this study scrutinises the conceptual history of civil society, demonstrates how its analytical and normative content has dynamically developed over time and, against this backdrop, proposes and justifies a clear-cut definition. Secondly, it is striking to observe how thin the empirical knowledge base, in which the current debate is grounded, is. Theoretically oriented contributions prevail over empirical enquiries, and where empirical accounts have been provided, evidence is more often than not anecdotal, focuses on specific aspects of civil society, or addresses individual cases, countries or contexts. For this reason, the second part of this study provides a systematic, comprehensive and comparative analysis of civil society in East-Central Europe, and assesses developments in the region in comparison to the wider European context. Thirdly, and in returning to more theoretical considerations, little attention has been paid to the limits of civil society. Civil society is seen as a cure-all for many, if not all, problems plaguing societies today. However, inasmuch as it can be a blessing, civil society can also be a curse for democracy, as the last part of this study argues. The challenge civil society faces is to develop such features that make it a strong contributor to democracy, and the approach proposed in this study hopes to open up novel avenues for scholarly exploration and for the practical development of civil society."

And what relation does such exchange have to the reproduction of the social structure? This thesis presents a new framework for the analysis of such phenomena based upon the theoretical methodology of Pierre Bourdieu. Using Bourdieu's conceptual tools of habitus, field and capital, the kinds of informal exchange typically analysed through the paradigms of clientelism, corruption, or ""informal institution"" are reconstructed as a new research object - the clandestine circulation of capital - and related to the broader ""economy of practices"" necessary to reproduce the social structure. In a considered development of Bourdieu's initial use of the term (which related to the clandestine circulation of cultural capital), the thesis demonstrates how the clandestine circulation of other forms and guises of capital can also subvert the normative intentions of merit and equality implicit in the formal institutions of the modern state. The thesis reconciles and expands upon various of Bourdieu's theoretical writings to develop a theory identifying both the objective resources of such circulation and the principles structuring it as a social practice. This new theory is then applied in detail to the field site of urban Beirut (the capital of Lebanon), and specifically in relation to the phenomenon of wasta (an Arabic word used to refer to all kinds of social influence). Through a detailed empirical study of the field site, the thesis attempts to demonstrate how clandestine circulation operates as a mechanism for the transformation and accumulation of capitals, and hence comes to play a determinant role in the reproduction of the social order, in a manner intimately connected to the specific nature of the Lebanese state."

The goal of this study is to provide a dynamic account of the ways actors draw symbolic boundaries toward people of different social status, as well as to explore the mechanisms of shifting those patterns across different ""orders of worth&rdquo;. At the same time, by using qualitative network analysis, it is addressed how these processes affected the actual choice of friends. I explored these issues by conducting indepth 105 interviews with upper middle class and working class respondents in Croatia and - in an asymmetric comparison - the upper middle class in Austria. The topic of class formation in postsocialism has been researched with qualitative, experience-near approach to friendship and identity building, as well as specific mechanisms through which these processes took place: the rise of private schooling, transnationalization, and the new entrepreneurial networks, sometimes crossing the bonds of legality, and entering the gray field of corruption and nepotism. At the same time, it is observed how the new influences were contradicted by the existing path dependencies - both in the form of the social hierarchies which managed to survive the project of destratification, and on the other hand, by legacies of the old regime in the form of egalitarian values. Finally, the area perspective does not represent a purpose to itself: even though postsocialism has stood in the center of this research, this study also contributes to the broader discussions about the nature of class divides in different contexts. Given the comprehensiveness of the theoretical and conceptual framework, this concerned several disciplinary fields: friendship studies, social network analysis, the scholarship on boundary maintenance, and even more abstract discussions on the role of actors in the times of social change. Despite the primarily empirical nature of my approach, this study also attempts to offer theoretical and methodological contributions in the broad field of study bound by cultural sociology, social anthropology, economic sociology, sociology of worth, and qualitative approaches to social stratification."

The Eastern Orthodox intellectual tradition and the philosophical discourse of political modernity","2007","STOECKL, Kristina","Totalitarianism; Political science -- Philosophy; Orthodox Eastern Church","Starting with a definition of political modernity from the angle of its greatest trial, namely totalitarianism, this study pursues two questions: How to conceptualize community after the experience of totalitarianism? And, what can the Eastern Orthodox intellectual tradition contribute to this debate? In both parts of Europe, totalitarianism raised the same political philosophical challenge: How to conceptualize the relationship between the individual and community in the light of the absolute communization of society and the simultaneous absolute atomization of individuals which totalitarianism had brought about? In contemporary Western political philosophy, the reflection upon this experience has taken three principled directions: the unequivocal embrace and conceptual elaboration of liberalism for which the works of John Rawls and J&uuml;rgen Habermas are exemplary, the communitarian critique of liberalism for which the works of Charles Taylor and Alasdair MacIntyre are representative, and the postmodern critique which, most clearly expressed in the works of Jean-Luc Nancy, ties the question of community back to the singular human being. In the present study, I add to these three approaches a viewpoint which challenges the limits of all of them. Focusing on the works of Sergej Horužij and Christos Yannaras, I demonstrate how these authors, while accepting the lesson of totalitarianism, seek foundations for their conceptualization of community and human subjectivity in the spiritual and intellectual tradition of Eastern Christianity. My aim is to re-think the political problematic of modernity from the East and beyond liberal, communitarian and postmodern political philosophy in order to extend the interpretative space of political modernity, to sharpen the problematic of community and the human subject after the experience of totalitarianism, and to single out those elements which are especially pertinent for a post-totalitarian philosophy of community: the quality of freedom, the role of practices, and the meaning of tradition."

Beyond the principal focus on these two pathways, the thesis also incorporates the examination of a third one, that of Russia, for various empirical, theoretical and methodological reasons. It explores in detail how the disparity in a quality of domestic political competition (largely determined by the strength of nationalist movements, the constellation of elites, and the European leverage and linkage) together with the variables of the external rent flows (timing of the external rent-expansion, costs, ownership and the perceived stability of rents) set the two countries on divergent paths. Going deeper, it analyses the logic behind both reproduction and change of political and economic institutions in Belarus and Ukraine. The focus on the dimension of external rents is the main added value and that what contributes to the uniqueness of this project, for it explains - why, when, how and in conjunction with what other factors, external economic rents steered the pathways away from autocratic socialism."

The analysis in all empirical studies is guided by the compensatory effect of social origin hypothesis according to which higher social origin families can reduce the negative impact of disadvantageous characteristics and life events on their children's educational outcomes. In detail, I study the effects of month of birth, parental separation, birth order, birth spacing, and maternal age. I use data on England, Germany, and Sweden. On a methodological level, I employ natural experiments, fixed effects methods, and instrumental variable (IV) estimation in order to control for the influence of unobserved confounding variables. Overall, I find support for the initial hypothesis with respect to the effects of month of birth, parental separation, and close birth spacing. Contrary to that, I find no systematic social origin differences in the effects of birth order and maternal age on educational outcomes. In the conclusion, I discuss the implications of these findings for theories of the intergenerational transmission of education, the differences in life chances of children from socio-economically advantaged and disadvantaged families, and the allocation of resources within families. I discuss how further research could possibly test in how far differences in parental involvement between social origin groups are underlying these relationships."
"http://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/24614","Competing Ideas: The religious foundations of the German and Italian welfare states","2012","HIEN, Josef",NA,"This thesis investigates the influence of political Catholicism and Catholic social doctrine on the evolution of the continental European welfare regimes. Paradoxically it finds that the doctrine had less influence on the formation of welfare regimes in countries where Catholicism was strong in contrast to countries where it was in a weak minority position. This finding does not only challenge many of the accounts that have perceived and analyzed religious influences on welfare state formation as a static and quantifiable variable but also addresses and rivals most postulations of mainstream welfare state theories such as Logic of Industrialism, Power Resource, Class Coalition and Employer Centered Approaches. In contrast to these postulations this thesis finds that welfare in continental Europe evolved during the 19th century and most of the 20th century as the result of a battle over ideas and worldviews between different societal groups and their political outlets. Which idea and worldview makes its way into institutional implementation is not primarily connected to the mere numerical strength or power resources of its societal and political representation but is a function of the performance of the programmatic ideas themselves. Decisive is how they strive in competition with other programmatic ideas. Two mechanisms stick out that determine whether programmatic ideas are successful: the performance and evolution of the idea in a process of ideational competition and the degree of ideational compatibility of a programmatic idea other ideas that enables the formation of ideational and political coalitions. The programmatic ideas and hence the worldview that performs these two tasks best wins its way into institutional implementation. Though, ideational competition, evolution and implementation is not solely endogenous to the battle of ideas but structured through a variety of exogenous factors such as the institutional (election system, mode of governance, degree of enfranchisement) and structural-material environment (pace of industrialization, spatial diffusion of economic development, number of ideational competitors). The thesis will show against the backdrop of the Italian and German welfare state development, from the end of the 19h century to the present, that these battles of ideas and worldviews were a major driver in how continental European political economies were structured during the 20th century."

Starting from the premise that the increased economic integration apparent in market liberalizations, the intensification of trade, the transnationalisation of production and the emergence of transnational financial markets exert pressures on states to reorient their economic and social policies towards the goal of increasing competitiveness and transforming themselves into so-called Competition States, the thesis examines the extent to which this state reorientation has been apparent in Europe and whether it has led to the emergence of unique or varied types of Competition States. The main argument is that, first, pressures for state restructuring vary among European states, with the Eurozone members being much less exposed to the pressures of the international financial markets and thereby much less likely to transform into Competition States and, second, those states that are exposed to such pressures respond in different ways and devise different strategies for increasing competitiveness. Based on the comparative case-studies of the Czech Republic and Slovakia as representatives of the two different types of Competition States, the thesis argues that the choice of these strategies is primarily shaped by the features of the domestic political system - more precisely, the strength or weakness of socio-economic issue divides as the main axis of competition in the political party system - rather than being determined by the position of states in the global or regional division of labour, or by their initial social and economic institutions."

This enables historical analysis without anachronism and a new interpretation of the European Union. By comparing the EU with the Holy Roman Empire (1648-1763) and the antebellum United States (1776-1865), he explains that the EU's international weakness is a result of its strength as a security system that stabilizes Europe. The author argues that continued American support and embedding in NATO is necessary in order for the EU to act on the world stage and to stabilize Europe in the long run. Through these theoretical innovations, he explores alternatives to state-building in the Third World."

The lack of justificatory accounts is particularly stark with respect to potential responsibilities of corporate agents concerning the socio-economic rights of poor population in &lsquo;burdened&rsquo; societies. As corporations have garnered public power through the constitutive force of the investment regime, no satisfactory account of correlative responsibilities is articulated. This thesis argues that this lack is caused by an existent disciplinary parallelism that foregoes engagement with the structural issue of corporate responsibilities as viewed under an institutional lens: Where liberal justice theory assumes away corporate agency for its institutional bias, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Business and Human Rights (BHR) mirror justice theory by assuming the corporate agent to be merely a private, economic agent. This thesis argues that this parallelism allows for a troubling lacuna in normative proposals that satisfactorily deal with the responsibilities corporate agents ought to be ascribed as public powers. In as much, this thesis problematizes the question of responsibilities corporate agents hold in light of their role in the creation, perpetuation and potential abatement of poverty. Since this is a question that concerns the side of the duty-bearer, the thesis focuses on an understanding of the agency of the corporation and the normative implications to be drawn from such an understanding. Arguing the lack of satisfactory justificatory accounts of corporate responsibilities that provide for guidance on corporate investment in burdened society, this thesis ends by developing a Basic Structure Model (BSM) as a viable tool to fill the lacuna in satisfactory normative proposals. In as much, the BSM can serve as a normative benchmark against which corporate engagement in burdened societies can be evaluated and reform can be effectuated."

The results relate to the critical view that presidential systems are inherently prone to institutional deadlock, deriving from their rigid constitutional design. My findings suggest that constitutional rules only determine broad parameters of variation, and that greater attention should be paid to the endogenous procedural design of the legislative process of policy approval in the explanation of institutional performance and inter-branch dynamics. The work is comparative and bridges quantitative and qualitative analysis. The data employed are original and allow for an innovative connection between theory-driven hypotheses on the incentives for majority political actors to circumvent ordinary procedures and play strategically employing procedural choices and political outcomes, by assessing the patterns of legislative production. The hypotheses are generated with attention to the degree of aggregation of interests in the decision-making process, as a measure of the representativeness of the decision-making process and hence as a general characteristic of the everyday democratic process. In fact, while democracy is understood as a process and not as a formal procedure, it is important to observe procedures as subtle devices where majority actors may find embedded comparative advantages to impose their political agenda unilaterally. The analysis further represents a thorough effort of theory testing whereby a competitive assessment of informational theories of legislative politics, exogenous factors such as electoral pressures or endogenous contextual characteristics such as the degree of fragmentation and polarization on the floor, is unpacked and delivers important analytical refinements to these theories. Finally, the normative agenda for analysis includes a view on constitutional choice and on methodological biases in the literature of Comparative Politics which have a large impact on the research output. The theoretical, substantive and methodological implications of the findings are thus reinserted into a normative view on procedural justice and the quality of democracy."

Even less known are the effects that mobilizations within institutions provoke. By combining field theory and social movement approach, my thesis aims to shed light on the variety of institutional impacts that the recent global wave of student mobilizations has produced within some Italian and English universities. More notably, I have looked at the way and to what extent student mobilizations have brought about changes in the university life in terms of student services and facilities, courses and curricula reorganization, and governance structure. To explore it, I have singled out three English (University of Birmingham, Sussex University, and University College of London) and three Italian universities (University of Turin, Sapienza of Rome, and Federico II of Naples), which have witnessed high levels of student mobilization over the past years (2008/2013). Have these mobilizations produced an impact within the university field? My argument is that the institutional context of universities does matter in explaining the variety and diversity of impacts that such mobilizations have brought about. The type and composition of governance affect both the strategies and tactics of the challengers (students), and the responses of the challenged (university leaders). Where universities are still run and governed by academics (Italy), students deploy a larger amount (and variety) of actions, and, thus, have a greater capacity of influence. Professors are more interested in restoring the conditions ensuring a good environment for teaching and research than challenging student protesters on their terrain. Academics are more eager to negotiate and compromise. By contrast, where universities are governed by academic managers (England), students have less tactics and strategies at their disposal and, thus, a minor capacity of influence. Managers are much more concerned than academics in neutralizing potential challengers and threats that damage the reputation and functioning of their universities."

This dissertation provides a description and analysis of the dynamics, characteristics and trajectory of Danish Muslims&rsquo; claims-making in response to the publication of the Muhammad caricatures. The thesis focuses on the determinants of Muslim claims-making during a well defined public controversy. As such, it aims to provide answers to the following questions: How were the grievances introduced by the Muhammad caricatures collectivized and turned into Muslim mobilisation? What role did the particular Danish context or Islamic ideas play in this process, and what kind of Islamic actors were active? Following a common assertion in much pub lic discourse about Islam stressing the incompatibility of Muslim claims- making and the political culture of secular democracies, the dissertation also investigates the extent to which the actual form and content of Muslim claims-making during the controversy challenged the principles of the secular public sphere The dissertation pays careful attention to the diversity of Muslim claims- making in the controversy and attempts to explain variance across types of Muslim actors, across time and between different arenas of claims-making. Departing from a theoretical integration of both social movement theory and elements of the sociology of religion, the dissertation argues that the nature of Muslim claims- making during the controversy was best described as de-essential, deexceptional and dynamic. Muslim mobilisation and claims-making was not predetermined, uniform and unidirectional, as has been suggested, but rather multivocal, multi-directional and multi-paced. Rather than leading to a unified protest, the publication of the Muhammad caricatures led to intense internal positioning among Muslim actors in Denmark. The claims-making by Danish Muslims seems to have been no more emotional, irrational or ideological than claims- making by other types of actors. In fact, the causal mechanisms driving Muslim mobilisation and claimsmaking in the controversy were similar to those driving other forms of contention. Thus, there seems to be little sui generis about Islam that made Danish Muslims react the way they did. Danish Muslims stressed partly different issues, solutions and interpretations of the principles of the secular public sphere than non-Muslim claimants did in the debate, but they did so using contentious performances and arguments that did not fundamentally challenge these basic principles. Finally, the claims- making of Danish Muslims during the controversy proved to be historically and spatially linked to prior instances of public smearing of Islam and the simultaneous actions by other claimants in the debate. Danish Muslims&rsquo; claimsmaking changed in form and content as the circumstances of the debate changed with, for example, the international escalation of the controversy."

The primary objective of the thesis is to introduce the analysis of sub-state territorial politics to the existing literature on Southeastern Europe (SEE) that has tended to be dominated by the national paradigm. The secondary objective is of a more theoretical nature and revolved around the argument against teleological and deterministic understandings of territories, nations and regions. The thesis compared four cases of multi-ethnic regionalisms, Dalmatia and Istria in Croatia as well as Sandžak and Vojvodina in Serbia. The emphasis in each case was on histories, intergroup relations and economic factors as elements of region-building. The thrust of the argument advanced is that regional entrepreneurs use these elements in their endeavours to institutionalise regional self-government. Apart from regional entrepreneurs&rsquo; political strategies, responses and opportunities provided by the centre influenced the outcomes of regionalist demands. The findings show that pre-existing sub-state territorial structures served as rallying points during the periods of democratisation that started in 2000 in both countries. In the period of ethnocratic rules of the 1990s, bottom-up multiethnic regionalist projects did not expand nor (re)established self-governing competences. Interpretations of histories by regional political actors have strongly correlated with the way regional polities and memberships were defined. Economically privileged regions such as Istria and Vojvodina were generally more assertive and successful in achieving (limited) asymmetric decentralisation. The thesis further illustrates that multi-ethnic regionalisms as opposed to nationalisms in SEE differ by focusing on historically emerging territory-specific institutions and not necessarily on exclusive ethno-national forms of political membership. The thesis also shows that new regionalist politics that combine functional economic interests, culture and identity politics with drives for autonomy are possible in SEE, albeit in a contested manner. In terms of contribution to the broader literature on nationalism and territorial politics, the thesis shows that many of the common assumptions about territorial autonomy projects as well as about teleological and unidirectional path from regionalism to nationalism need to be reassessed in light of the findings of this thesis."

The theoretical perspective of this research is at the intersection of Science Studies and Political Sciences. The Science Studies perspective is, however, clearly predominant. This research, based on semi-open interviews, is empirical and the cases selected are decision-making processes with a strong technical-scientific dimension. More precisely, the cases selected are ten recent decision-making processes for the setting-up of incineration plants in France: the decision-making processes selected ended between 2003 and 2005. Beyond the empirical research, the research intends to improve existing theories and to provide novel concepts for the analysis of the public engagement and the mobilisation of scientific expertise by the public. Part (i) shows that, in spite of the numerous legal possibilities that the local public authorities have, the level of public engagement was low. There was therefore very little political will to engage the public. The analysis suggests that an early participation sponsored by the public authority may diminish the degree of controversy of a decision-making process, whereas consultation is less likely to reach this goal. Finally, it seems that a high level of communication initiatives sponsored by the local NGOs is likely to lead to the abandonment of the incineration plant project. Part (ii) shows that local NGOs may make positive contributions to public decisionmakings, widening the issue under discussion, and bringing alternative valid scientific and technical expertises. Therefore, the analysis support the position hold by many Science Studies scholars who claim that public participation is likely to improve the quality of the overall expertise delivered to decision-makers. The analysis is also an agreement with a fairly positive view of NIMBY, which supports that the public may have a good grasp of and reasonable concern for health and welfare which are ignored by technical and administrative elites. Finally, the analysis supports the position hold by the &lsquo;critical&rsquo; Public Understanding of Science scholars, that is, that the public is able to reflect on the source of their knowledge."

Self-regulation by business in South Africa and China","2010","THAUER, Christian R.","Corporate governance -- South Africa; Corporate governance -- China; Industrial management","Under which conditions do firms engage in corporate social responsibility (csr) in the context of a regulatory void? Tackling this question the thesis suggests a set of theoretical propositions that explain the engagement of firms in csr. A number of new factors are theorized that derive from the application of transaction cost economics and of the concept of asset specificity to the analysis of intra-firm relationships between management and specific sub-units. These factors are &lsquo;human asset specificity&rsquo; and &lsquo;production-specific assets&rsquo;. Also, the thesis argues that &lsquo;filter&rsquo;-effects of the institutional set-up of national arenas, which have so far not been accounted for, are factors that explain patterns of csr across countries. In addition to these newly theorized factors, the thesis identifies those factors that figure prominently in the literature as explanations for csr, such as &lsquo;investments in a brand name&rsquo;, &lsquo;NGOs&rsquo;, &lsquo;associations&rsquo;, &lsquo;public-private-&rsquo; and &lsquo;private-private partnerships&rsquo;. Subjected to systematic qualitative empirical assessments in the context of the South African textile and automotive industries and the Chinese textile industry, it emerges that those factors usually pointed to by authors and practitioners alike as explanations for csr lack empirical basis. To be more precise, environmentally and socially aware consumers, NGOs, associations as well as public-private and private-private partnerships are factors that do not explain csr to the extent commonly assumed. Those factors, however, that were newly theorized in this study gain strong support in the empirical assessment. These factors are &lsquo;human asset specificity&rsquo;, &lsquo;productionspecific assets&rsquo; and the &lsquo;filter&rsquo;-effects of national arenas. In conclusion, the study suggests that csr is best viewed as the unintended outcome of intra-firm asset specific investments as well as of &lsquo;filter&rsquo;-effects deriving from the institutional context. The promise of csr appears to hold surprisingly well, though for other reasons than commonly assumed."

EU foreign policy sanctions and the quest for credibility","2012","HELLQUIST, Elin","European Union -- Foreign relations; European Union countries -- Politics and government","The European Union (EU) turns increasingly to negative sanctions - a classical tool of international relations and the sharpest expression of the EU&rsquo;s common foreign and security policy (CFSP) - in response to a variety of norm violations in world politics. This thesis investigates how the EU positions itself and receives a position on the world scene by using sanctions. Regardless of whether sanctions successfully induce target change or not, they signal distance to some actors and proximity to others. In recognition of sanctions&rsquo; deeply relational character beyond the sender-target polarity, the thesis juxtaposes the EU&rsquo;s self-understandings with the perceptions of a significant bystander: the African Union (AU). The thesis exposes patterns of disagreement and consensus as concerns logics of action, autonomy and volume of the sanctions policy, as well as policy linkages between sanctions and other external actions. It combines qualitative and quantitative analysis of European Parliament debates on sanctions between 1999 and 2012 with scrutiny of official documents and semi-structured interviews at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa. The analysis reveals that self-oriented justifications dominate EU discourse on sanctions. Policymakers are concerned with how to successfully inflict harm on the targets, but mechanisms for making targets change are discussed only exceptionally. Instead, proponents and critics reason about sanctions in terms of the good or bad they do to the EU as a sender, and in particular to the Union&rsquo;s credibility as an international actor. This thesis disputes the artificial separation between material and symbolic types of sanctions, to instead demonstrate the need to distinguish between primarily self-oriented and primarily target-oriented sanctions. While the AU draws on the European experience in institution building and has high esteem of the EU&rsquo;s resource capacity, it favours ideational autonomy in its own sanctions doctrine against unconstitutional changes of government. AU perceptions show that the EU has a credibility deficit as an external sender of sanctions. Deep-rooted historical impressions of Europe subsist and are strongly associated with the former colonial powers. The EU&rsquo;s use of sanctions seems to add to these impressions rather than to challenge them."

Following the collapse of the communist regimes, the socio-economic reorientation of these societies towards market democracy brought an end to the 'communist taboo against unemployment' (Baxandall). Apart from organisational matters, unemployment now needs to be dealt with as an integral element of many individual and family biographies, and indicates the re-consideration of criteria of social integration throughout the life course. Young people hold a particularly delicate position in both the transformation of society and the accompanying process of knowledge renewal. First, unemployment has become an additional option in their transition to the world of work, which used to be rather linear. Second, it is largely up to them to negotiate 'old' and 'new' meanings and to carry them into the new society. Against this background, the thesis, a qualitative-empirical exploration, studies emerging notions of work and unemployment among young people in the post-communist context of Lithuania, a country that represents a case of particularly rapid and radical transformation. In line with the two dimensions of unemployment mentioned above, the conceptual frame of reference consists of two sensitising concepts. On the one hand, the now available option of unemployment places young people in a situation of 'biographical uncertainty' (Wohlrab-Sahr). On the other hand, unemployment has become a new dimension of the '(mis)recognition' (Honneth) of a person's status in society. These two main axes of research conceptualise unemployment as an ambivalent moment of 'danger' (Douglas) that accompanies young people on their way to the world of work. Altogether, the study intends to contribute to youth sociology and to research into post-communist transformations. The discussion of the empirical analysis, which is based on 30 in-depth interviews with young Lithuanians in linear and non-linear transitions to working life, is organised into three parts. The first discusses the reconstructed meanings of work and unemployment in the perspective of young people. The presentation of the findings follows the parties in an imagined triangle consisting of the individual, the state, and the 'other' (i.e. the unemployed), as well as their 'relations'. The second part reflects on a snapshot of the currently imagined gender-work relations and their consequences for anticipated family transitions in the perspective of young women revealing the landscape of perceived options. Finally, the third part introduces three patterns of youth transitions to working life (continuation, liberation, and trajectory) together with associated time perspectives of biographical uncertainty. The conclusion reviews the main lines of argumentation against the background of the initial sensitising conceptual frame of reference and identifies issues for further investigation."

More specifically I ask how is military retribution enacted, articulated and framed by state actors, social movements, public discourses and personal narratives. Most scholars traditionally interpret the mechanisms of retribution as either a rationalist strategy of deterrence, or as a culturalist logic of revenge and emotions. Transcending the duality of structure and agency, I conceptualize the ""calculus of state retribution"" as a relational process in which violent exchange is both a form of action and reaction - the generator and outcome of ethno-national conflict. Thus, state violence is conceptualized as a category of practice, namely as a set of repertoires and methods of retribution, as well as well as a discursive framing category which legitimizes and challenges the concept of raison d'&eacute;tat. Opening up the ""black box"" of political violence I propose an analytic model of retribution, which combines revenge, punishment and deterrence, categorical violence and passionate reprisal. These modalities of state retribution, I argue, are always entangled together and draw political and military strength precisely from such entanglement and elasticity. Drawing on discourse analysis of media sources from the turn of the 19th century to the present, as well as on in-depth interviews with policy-makers, generals, infantry soldiers and activists, the research employs frame analysis to engage theories of state rationality, state power, strategic interaction and emotions in politics. In the context of Israeli militarism, retaliation functions as a meta-frame and a total relationship, which mediates state action, across scales and units of analysis. Ultimately, the research points to the extension of the discourse on retributive justice to the radical (both right- and left-wing) fringes of civil society."

Nicolas Guilhot explores this question in his penetrating look at how the U.S. government, the World Bank, political scientists, NG0s, think tanks, and various international organizations have appropriated the movement for democracy and human rights to export neoliberal policies throughout the world. His work charts the various symbolic, ideological, and political meanings that have developed around human rights and democracy movements. Guilhot suggests that these shifting meanings reflect the transformation of a progressive, emancipator), movement into an industry dominated by ""experts"" ensconced in positions of power. Guilhot's story begins in the 1950s when U.S. foreign policy experts promoted human rights and democracy as part of a ""democratic international"" to fight the spread of communism. Later, the unlikely convergence of anti-Stalinist leftists and the nascent neoconservative movement found a place in the Reagan administration. These ""State Department Socialists,"" as they were known, created policies and organizations that provided financial and technical expertise to democratic movements and also supported authoritarian, anti-communist regimes, particularly in Latin America."

Participatory budgeting and frames of citizen participation in France, Germany and Great Britain","2009","R&Ouml;CKE, Anja",NA,"This research investigates the processes of adaptation of participatory budget (PB) institutions to France, Germany, and Great Britain in relation to frames of citizen participation, for instance &lsquo;participatory&rsquo; democracy or &lsquo;community empowerment&rsquo;. I define frames as relatively coherent but flexible idea combinations that contain cognitive and normative assumptions about the issue at stake (in the present case citizen participation). The process of PB, developed in Porto Alegre, Brazil, includes ordinary citizens in the allocation of public funds and thereby breaks with a traditional approach to democracy. Various actors and actor networks have imported it into Europe since around 10 years, where it belongs to the most interesting participatory instruments. But how far-reaching are the results of PB in Europe? Central questions of the research, a comparative case study of three PB processes investigated with qualitative methods, concern the relation between frames of citizen participation and PB institutions, the degree of procedural and political innovation of PB, and the similarities and differences between frames of citizen participation in Germany, France, and Great Britain today. I argue that frames, of which the national and cross-country diffusion is strongly related to the activities of single policy entrepreneurs and networks, are never simply &lsquo;put into practice&rsquo;, but are adapted to the respective institutional setting and interpreted or re-interpreted in line with contextual features and the changing political interests and normative perspectives of the organising actors. Whereas new frames are in the beginning promoted by a small group of people, they might develop into more widely shared assumptions about the conduct of public policies, i.e. become a new r&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel of public policies. The three cases of PB analysed show distinct results in relation to the degree of innovation, which is influenced by different intervening factors (namely the frame of citizen participation, political and administrative support), as well as by the pace of the procedural development. Once implemented, a PB process may produce unexpected results, which in some cases become even more important than the initial goals. One hypothesis that emerges from this study is indeed that despite the political focus of many organisers, PB processes might contribute primarily to the introduction of a user-oriented administration rather than a &lsquo;democratisation of democracy&rsquo;. With regard to the frames of citizen participation in France, Germany, and Great Britain today, the current situation is characterised by more differences than similarities. Although all frames considered here share an overall criticism with regard to a &lsquo;pure&rsquo; model of representative democracy, their particular focus differs (e.g. devolution of power to local citizens and communities without modifying the centres of power; participation in terms of top-down consultative devices or as a second, equally legitimate basis of democracy next to the vote for representatives). These differences, as well as diverse PB and other participatory practices, reflect different political traditions in Europe as well as distinct scenarios with regard to the future development of the democratic order."

This thesis aims to bridge these two strands and offer a broader understanding of home-states' role in diaspora-making by analysing why and how Turkey has evolved into a hybrid origin-reference state claiming and engaging an expansive diaspora composed of emigrants and a broad set of kin populations defined beyond co-ethnicity. The empirical analysis traces the state's transformation through focusing on its categorisation and identification practices and policy-discourse repertoire oriented towards these different types of transborder populations over the last two decades. It argues that the ways in which the state identified and targeted both emigrants and external kin groups changed as a function of the interaction between: i) economic liberalisation and outward economic expansion, ii) shifts in the state's foreign political and identitarian positioning vis-&agrave;-vis the West and its non-Western neighbourhood and iii) differing elite-sponsored conceptions of nationhood and narratives of nationalism. These interacting underlying factors have led the home-state to gradually expand the scope and diversify the composition of its transborder membership universe, while simultaneously engage in practices of selection and hierarchisation within its broad diaspora based on its changing definitions of ideal emigrants and external kin. This thesis also scrutinises the implications of changing rationalities and modalities of the state's diaspora making for the targeted populations. Empirical examination of the cases of the Turkey-origin emigrant population in Germany and the co-ethnic minority in Bulgaria demonstrates that the home-state, through its varying definition, (sub)categorisation, and engagement efforts, significantly impacts the diasporic membership claims and practices of both emigrants and co-ethnics. State-led diaspora-making has (re)structuring effects particularly on intra-minority dynamics as well as different sections' stances towards and relations with the home-state."

This unprecedented ease of access to a wealth of information and contacts presents a challenge to national governments who wish to control and restrain some of this activity. In recent years, Internet control has become one of the major indicators to assess the balance between freedom and security in democracies. This book explores and compares how, why, and to what extent, national governments decide to control the Internet and how this impacts on crucial socio-economic activities and fundamental civil rights. The author provides detailed studies on the US, Germany, Italy and further case studies on Brazil, Canada, India, the Netherlands, South Africa and Switzerland, to address topics such cyberterrorism, the protection of information infrastructure, and the impact on individual privacy and freedom of speech. This is the first cross-country, comparative study on the issue of Internet control.

A comparison of youth in advanced societies in-and outside Europe","2012","DRABOWICZ, Tomasz Piotr",NA,"This dissertation merges two streams of research hitherto rarely mixed together: class analysis and digital inequality studies. It also focuses on the comparative research of adolescents from advanced societies &ndash; a social category relatively underrepresented in studies on digital inequality, partly because of &lsquo;the myth of the cyberkid&rsquo; (Facer and Furlong 2001) that is prevalent in the field and that suggests the young people are naturally competent users of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). Additionally, this dissertation deals with the influence of gender on the patterns of inequality in access to the ICTs among adolescents. The dissertation&rsquo;s empirical basis is that of information on the ICTs possession, skills, and usage collected for 39 countries participating in the 2006 wave of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) of fifteen year-olds (OECD 2006a, 2006b, 2009a, 2009b). The results of the analysis reported in chapter three of this dissertation allow concluding that the &lsquo;old&rsquo; social class inequalities in the parents&rsquo; generation are not being reproduced with respect to the &lsquo;new&rsquo; digital inequalities in the children&rsquo;s generation. Among adolescents in 39 countries under investigation (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, South Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Macao, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, and Uruguay), social class does not differentiate access to the new forms of cultural capital associated with possession, skills, and usage of ICTs. The differences between service class and working class children (the particular focus of the study undertaken in chapter three of this thesis) are not substantial as far as skills and usage access are concerned, and they depend on the availability of the technology among the general population as far as physical access is concerned. Thus, one may expect that as the Internet penetration rate among the general population increases in the countries in which in 2006 service class adolescents enjoyed substantially higher probability of having the Internet access at home, so the advantage of service class adolescents in these societies will decrease to unsubstantial levels already characteristic of technologically more advanced countries. ii Chapter four of this dissertation investigates how gender exerts its influence on contemporary adolescents with respect to their access to the ICTs. The chapter&rsquo;s focus is on the so-called usage access. Ordinal regression modeling is used as a method for data investigation. The analysis points to the persistence of gender inequality seemingly in favour of boys. In all countries under investigation, boys report using computers and the Internet for educational purposes more often than girls. Controlling for the 2006 value of the national GDP per capita, the level of a country&rsquo;s gender inequality measured by the Gender Gap Index does not have any statistically significant effect on gender gap in educational use of ICTs. A sign of the gender coefficient suggest, however, that the increase in society&rsquo;s gender-equality is associated with the increase in boys&rsquo; advantage over girls as regards the frequency of ICT/Internet educational use. The possibility that this advantage of boys is in fact a sign of their educational underperformance is discussed. Another possibility is also discussed, namely, that girls&rsquo; decreased (in comparison with boys) frequency of using computers and the Internet for playing computer games might, counterintuitively, be the source of girls&rsquo; disadvantage in the future. Chapter five of this dissertation investigates whether one&rsquo;s having the Internet access at home, one&rsquo;s gender, and social class membership of one&rsquo;s father differentiate the frequency of fifteen-year olds&rsquo; advanced computer use. Multiple Correspondence Analysis, one of the specific methods of Geometric Data Analysis, is used as a method for data investigation. The analysis reveals that the father&rsquo;s social class &ndash; operationalized according to the Erikson-Goldthorpe seven-class scheme &ndash; does not differentiate adolescents&rsquo; frequency of computer use. Neither gender nor having the Internet access at home turns out to be a source of substantial inequality in adolescents&rsquo; computer use, too. In terms of policy recommendations the conclusions prescribed by the analysis presented in this dissertation are as follows. Given the lack of any substantive digital inequality of any kind among adolescents in the countries under investigation neither the public authorities of any level (local/regional/national/supranational) nor the NGOs need to allot money for initiatives aimed at combating digital exclusion among this age category."

In the domain of the political sciences, the Internet has been welcomed for its potential to facilitate political practice. However, it is also commonly noted that the Internet is not equally distributed and not everybody can equally make the most of its potential. This is why the Digital Divide is perceived as the obstacle which limits the potential of the Internet to influence politics. Today, we are entering the third decade after the advent of the WWW, and the Internet is used far more broadly worldwide. We also have much more empirical evidence about Internet use. However, most research until now has concentrated on Western countries which have similar political systems, and therefore neglects a larger comparative perspective. This study empirically resizes the relation of causality between the Digital Divide and the influence of the Internet on politics. I explore how other contextual factors are determinant in this regard. In order to test this empirically, I set up a dataset tracking internet use, internet infrastructure, internet politics, blogging practices and social, economic and democratic factors of over 190 countries. Through cross-national analysis, first, I size the current status of the Digital Divide across countries. Second, I explore whether and how this scenario affects the inequalities in using the Internet for practicing politics. By following a constructivist approach, I explore not only how political parties are unequally present online across countries to perform conventional forms of politics, but also how citizens and social movements use the Internet to practice civic engagement. I pay particular attention to how people use social network organization tools to empower their own information narratives. My empirical findings confirm that the Digital Divide plays a limited role in explaining the relation between the Internet and politics. Rather, the use of the Internet to practice politics is mainly determined by the political context in which political actors operate. In this framework, the Digital Divide is only one of the several factors characterizing the national context."

The Komsomol can be regarded as an important stepping stone within the pathways into the communist elite. Given that these young functionaries eventually had to replenish the ranks of the established communist elite, the study proposes to conceptualize them as the prospective communist elite. It is this prospect of them becoming the communist elite that makes them so interesting to study: their position in the Komsomol signified that they were pre-selected possessors of the quality to strive for &lsquo;good life&rsquo;. Simultaneously however they are observed as people who desired to organize their accomplishment by following the rules of the game. However, with the breakdown of the communist regime this kind of career logic has abruptly declined. Against this background, the main research question is: &lsquo;What happened to the former functionaries of the Komsomol in the course of the post-communist transformation, and why?&rsquo; This thesis attempts to shed light on questions of elite formation by drawing on retrospective accounts of insiders. These perspectives represent a previously hardly researched &lsquo;other side&rsquo; of an experience that took place before and after the collapse of communism, an aspect which remains indispensable in understanding the post-communist development. Altogether 36 biographical in-depth interviews were carried out in 2005 with the Central Committee functionaries of the cohort of 1986-1989 in Lithuania. Interviews were also conducted with former functionaries in Belarus and utilized to facilitate the analysis of the Lithuanian data. The discussion of data is organized into two parts. The first empirical part deals with several aspects of the condition of the Komsomol functionaries at the moment of the exit from communism. This part outlines the main desires that motivate their decisions at this turbulent time; it also aims to explore the meaning of this moment in order to understand how it may have affected their lives. Was it a moment of loss? Or was it a moment of liberation? The second empirical part of the study explores the mobility of the former functionaries after the breakdown of communism. Here the study observes how the striving which initially propelled them into the communist structures was eventually converted within the post-communist structures. How did those people who were striving for &lsquo;good life&rsquo; in the old system organise their accomplishment during post-communism? While the study represents an exploration into the subjective notions of accomplishment, it also proposes a reflection on how this process of subjective striving results in elite formation."

Moreover, this thesis offers a new tool for a comprehensive impact evaluation of the performance of the Russian taxbenefit system - the static microsimulation model RUSMOD. The model allows testing of the firstorder distributional impacts of both existing and hypothetical policy designs, while keeping other national parameters - original income distribution and sociodemographic structure - constant. Furthermore, being fully compatible with EUROMOD - the taxbenefit model for the European Union - the Russian model is suitable for crosscountry policy learning. The study assesses the performance of child targeted allowances in Russia and shows that it is possible to achieve better distributional results, even at the same level of spending, by means of better targeting and unification of programme design across the regions. In addition, the study estimates the potential gains if the Russian programme of child allowances were to be redesigned along the policy parameters of the relevant programmes in four European countries - Sweden, Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom - countries representing different family policy regimes. This analysis suggests that there is a significant scope for expanding the budget for child allowances in Russia. In terms of design, the best distributive outcomes are achieved by applying a mix of universal and meanstested child benefits. On a theoretical level, this thesis contributes to the international debate on the directions of welfare state reform in conditions of contemporary demographic and economic challenges. On a practical level, it contributes to the promotion of the evidence based approach to social intervention. The scope of applications of the Russian model can be easily extended to the analysis of other taxbenefit policies and other EU countries. The output of the model can be incorporated into the dynamic model framework, to study the effect of policy reforms on labour supply and demographic behaviour."

It wishes to establish a dialogue with a current debate, marked by very different interpretations regarding the economic and developmental performance of Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. It argues that from similar starting positions, individual sectors in CEE economies could follow widely different modes of transnationalization in sectors where access to technology was cheap &ndash; yet domestic actors needed to secure capital, which neither the state nor domestic private banking sectors could offer them. Contrary to technology-intensive sectors where proprietary technologies might &ldquo;force&rdquo; developing economies to adopt an integrationist strategy relying on MNCs to secure financial assets and technology, in less technology-intensive sectors, different pathways of transnationalization remained open, yielding different developmental outcomes. For illustrating this argument, the thesis uses the case of the dairy sector&rsquo;s post-Socialist restructuring in Hungary and Poland: Hungary experienced the developmental failure of an integrationist strategy, while Poland illustrates the unforeseen benefits of an autonomist pathway. The thesis argues that different policy choices in the two countries reflected differences in the resources and organization of state and non-state actors, the types of linkages tying them, and different institutional legacies stretching back to the Socialist period. In so doing, it seeks to show that even for small and open economies, the diversity of developmental pathways is substantially wider than usually assumed: neither too deterministic theories such as dependent underdevelopment, nor too general typologies such as the Varieties of Capitalism framework can grasp the actual diversity of developmental experiences, which exist at a sector level, especially in less technology-&shy;-intensive sectors where a wide scope for variation exists. On the other hand, this thesis also shows that particular modes of transnationalization can also be abandoned for alternative strategies when they fail to secure tangible benefits to domestic actors. Modes of transnationalization for developing economies are more diverse but also more transient than often assumed."

Using a combination of comparative work examining twenty four countries using the data on student achievement among 15 year olds from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2006 and analyses with longitudinal case-study data from Ireland, this study builds upon existing knowledge in the area of stratification of educational opportunity. The methodology lends itself to a detailed investigation of the differentiating practices within countries and within schools and their impact on student achievement. In particular, this thesis focuses on the relationship between socioeconomic background, socioeconomic composition of the school and how students are sorted for instruction. In an attempt to contribute to the debate surrounding tracking practices the thesis explores how school composition effects vary depending on how a country sorts its students for instruction, the relationship between tracking and school composition and the role that curricular differentiation plays in explaining differential achievement. The findings highlight that the known effect of how countries sort their students for instruction on the inequality of educational achievement appears to be mediated through school composition effects. The results show that differentiation at the country level accentuates compositional effects, i.e. school composition matters more in highly differentiated education systems. However, the pattern is less extreme for high socioeconomic status students; that is highly differentiated systems do less to magnify compositional effects for high socioeconomic status students as compared to low socioeconomic status students. In Ireland, schools that track their students are achieving less than their counterparts in non-tracked schools which is associated with the lower social class composition of the school. Furthermore, there is inequality of educational opportunity within tracked schools. Those from lower social backgrounds do significantly worse in tracked schools compared to their peers. Access the curriculum is more differentiated in tracked schools with those in the top track gaining the best access to the higher levels of curricula. The findings in this thesis illustrate the payoff between offering an achievement advantage to a minority, or maximising achievement among the greatest number. Differentiating practices maximise the achievement advantage for the few who are high socioeconomic status students in high socioeconomic composition schools. Schools that track maximise the achievement advantage for the few who enter the school with higher ability levels by giving them better access to the curriculum which widens the gap in achievement between track placements. Comprehensive education systems and schools that do not track their students keep the channels of movement between courses of study open (Turner, 1960) and in doing so appear to maximise the achievement of a greater number with a small loss of achievement for the minority at the top. By exploring the role of differentiating practices within countries and within schools, this dissertation contributes to a greater understanding of how social class status and school-composition effects vary depending on how students are sorted for instruction."

Crafting trust in political institutions","2012","NIELSEN HASSING, Julie",NA,"Why do people trust certain political institutions and not others, and how best to account for trust&rsquo;s relationship with democratic participation? This dissertation focuses on the relationship between democratic participation and deliberation, and its influence on political trust. It is based on a puzzle, showing almost as high a level of trust in the European Union (EU) vis-&agrave;-vis the national democracy.1 This finding is counterintuitive. Most recent research on the EU emphasizes a converse relationship. A popular interpretation of &ldquo;the EU democratic malaise&rdquo; is that the EU is neither transparent nor understood by its people. Hence people cannot trust it, and they reject or show reluctance towards further integration, for example, in popular referendums or by the very low voter turnout in the European Parliament elections. My initial descriptive findings show a different pattern. People actually trust the EU to quite a high degree in comparison to the trust they place in the national democracy.2 So I ask the question: to what degree does enhanced deliberation and participation lead to increased political trust? Thus, the dissertation tests the relationship between political trust and different kinds of participation. The first part of the dissertation (chapters 1 and 2) places the puzzle in a theoretical context, and provides the framework of the study. Chapter 3 describes Denmark as the study&rsquo;s case. The second part (chapters 4 and 5) explores the research questions empirically through OLS regression analysis and laboratory experiments. The study has two main conclusions:  The relationship between trust and deliberation and participation is curvilinear. If provided with too much or too little deliberative participation, people have less political trust.  Differences exist between what constitutes trust at the EU level and the national level as well as between different cultures and different political systems."

The thesis examines the relationship between the central state and regions in Germany and Spain, showing how Europeanization has served to weaken the powers of the regions. In both countries, the regions were forced to cooperate more closely with the centre, but the institutional impact in the two countries has been strikingly different. In Germany the existing cooperative Federal system was reinforced, but in Spain the traditional competitive relationship between the levels of government could not continue. Europeanization has led to a significant change in the pattern of Spanish politics, turning rivalry into cooperation. This thesis thus presents an important analysis of the impact of Europeanization on domestic politics, and on the relationship between states and regions in particular."

This thesis conceptualizes EU viability from an internal perspective, that is, the viability of the process of integration rather than Europe as a viable actor in international politics. Adopting the concept of a compound polity to understand the tensions inherent in the EU, viability is defined in relation to the -rules of the game- of this compound system. This gambit has a twofold purpose. Firstly, it permits an analogy with another historical case of a compound system, the antebellum US republic. Secondly, it enables the specification of two scenarios of viability in a compound polity: dynamic equilibrium and voluntary centralization. Four aspects of the rules of the game (institutions, expectations, competence allocation and representative functions) are analysed to determine which scenario the EU follows. The analogy with the early US and its own conflicts over these four elements of the rules of the game is then contrasted with the EU experience. Five differences in how these disputes arise and the means for trying to settle them are singled out to explain the differing problems of viability in both compound polities. The results of this analogical analysis are then used to explore the appropriateness of certain proposed changes to the rules of the game in the EU, notably in the area of political representation. In a system accustomed to dynamic equilibrium, enhancing the representation of individuals is often seen as a condition for favouring more voluntary centralization. However, the analysis of conflicts over the rules of the game in two compound systems suggests a more cautious approach is required in the interests of viability. Hence this study presents itself as a significant, if incomplete, initial step in the process of identifying what makes the EU viable."

It does that by examining cross-national &amp; cross-temporal variation program features and specificities to identify patterns of association with outcomes of interest such as poverty levels, individual long-term income, earnings and assets. The main data source used throughout the study is the 2007 longitudinal component of the European Union-Survey of Income and Living Condition (EU-SILC). Social assistance programs in CEE are a marginal component of the social protection system in all eight countries. They serve small populations, spend relatively little compared to needs and the benefits they award are largely a top-up for their clients. Both the ability of the programs to reach the poor and, the ability to provide them with sufficient resources to bring them above the relative poverty threshold are found lacking. However, the more extensive and liberal programs achieved higher effectiveness in reducing poverty, and directed a greater share of their resources to the very poor. Contrary to theoretical expectations, no link was found between generosity and efficiency. Discretion has been linked to very poor targeting performance, suggesting arbitrariness in entitlement and spending decisions. No conclusive evidence of a work disincentive effect of social assistance programs could be discerned. Most importantly, any work disincentives that the programs might create could not be linked to the benefits they provide. Instead, lower future incomes appear to be related to program participation as such rather than disbursed benefits. Finally, social assistance programs could not be shown to impede asset accumulation among low-income households. With the exception of debt management, there are no indications that the income floor implicit in the programs represents a disincentive to saving."

Two forms of social capital are identified. Bonding refers to a dense network with thick trust and is measured as the strength of family ties, co-ethnic ties and trust in the family. Bridging implies a crosscutting network with thin trust and is measured as inter-ethnic ties and outward orientation. Making use of quantitative research methods, it is examined to what extent bonding and bridging for immigrants in the Netherlands and Germany explain a higher likelihood of employment, higher income, higher occupational status and shorter unemployment duration. Results show that 1) bridging networks positively affect all economic outcomes identified; 2) bonding networks do not affect economic outcomes; 3) levels of trust (neither thick nor thin) do not explain economic outcomes; 4) returns to social capital are much higher for men than for women; 5) findings are similar for Germany and the Netherlands. Limitations and implications are discussed."

Why do some states seek to achieve economic growth through policies that emphasize economic efficiency and level playing fields while others pursue prosperity by stimulating specific economic sectors and activities? Challenging conventional ideational, partisan and political-institutional accounts, this dissertation proposes a professional explanation for neoliberal reform. Based on insights from the sociology of professions and the state and bureaucracy literatures, the thesis argues that the extent of neoliberal reform in large part is a function of the position of neoclassical economists within the state. To explore this argument, the dissertation examines tax policy-making in four small states in the period 1980-2010, namely New Zealand, Ireland, Norway and Denmark. The comparison of both similar cases with different outcomes and different cases with similar outcomes - that is, a ""mixed systems design"" - allows us to evaluate a set of explanations for neoliberal reform. Based on official documents, secondary literature and more than 70 interviews with policy-making elites, the analysis combines comparative analysis, process-tracing and counterfactual reasoning. The dissertation finds that neoliberal tax policies were adopted in some countries (New Zealand and Norway) and not in others (Ireland and Denmark) because of the varying entrenchment of the economics profession within the state. Where economists obtained a prominent position in the state during the Keynesian era, finance bureaucracies were highly receptive to the neoclassical ideas that spread within the economics discipline in the 1970s and 80s. Where the position of economists was weak or fragmented, neoclassical thinking did not break through. The position of neoclassical economists in the bureaucracy had a profound impact on policy-making not only because it determined what ideas were present, but also because the specific expertise and behavioural norms of neoclassical economists strengthened their influence vis-&agrave;-vis politicians in the formulation of policy. These findings contribute to a growing literature about the role of the economics profession in the diffusion in neoliberal policies."

It looks upon measures imposed after, or in force by 1992, year of the signing of the Treaty on European Union which created the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Sanctions wielded within four legal frameworks are considered: CFSP sanctions, the suspension of development aid and trade preferences under the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, the withdrawal of trade privileges under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), and other sanctions imposed by the EU outside these frameworks. Departing from the assumptions made by theories on the operation of sanctions, the study puts forward a series of hypotheses, which are subsequently tested with Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) and empirical case-studies. After presenting some findings, the investigation concludes by assessing the relevance of traditional sanctions theory in accounting for the efficacy of EU sanctions, and the implications of the findings for the conceptualisation of the EU's international role."

Based on the idea that immigration must not be understood as a one-dimensional category that parties endorse or dismiss, support or oppose, I investigate its multidimensional nature, and the importance of local factors and opportunities in determining public debates. Focusing on the dimensional choices and framing strategies of competing electoral actors, I propose an account of the different constitutive dimensions of immigration debates, and suggest that parties - next to competing over different issues - also compete with one another by selectively and strategically emphasizing different aspects of the same social reality. In particular, I identify three main dimensions of the immigration issue - the socioeconomic, cultural and religious, and law and order dimension - and seven specific frames corresponding to the arguments and justifications mobilized by political actors to articulate support and opposition to immigration. The construction of public agendas in electoral campaign periods is measured through an empirical content analysis of the coverage of local elections by newspapers and of local parties' electoral manifestos across two campaigns in the cities of Milan, Rome and Prato (2004-2011). The results show not only that debates in different local settings deal with immigration in substantively different ways, but also that parties' electoral strategies rely upon the thematic structure of the issue, exploiting immigration dimensions in order to increase the accessibility and resonance of their messages among local electorates. The results of this dissertation offer one of the first comprehensive analyses of an issue that has too often been considered ""emerging"" in party competition, showing that when the issue cannot be dismissed, actors compete on its constitutive dimensions by mobilizing aspects on which they enjoy a strategic advantage. These findings pave the way to connect this field of research with other promising areas within the social and political sciences, such as public opinion research and the study of mediatization and communication in party politics, providing new insights into electoral politics and campaigning."

I focus upon the entry-level diplomats to a greater degree than in the older works on political elite and diplomacy. The key to capturing the process of circulation/ reproduction among diplomatic elites is through analysis of the general characteristics of diplomats as well as the system of personnel selection. I argue that a better understanding of the transformation processes could be achieved by looking at people at the entry level into political elite, i.e., by looking at newcomers. The thesis is further set out to show how the historical, political and cultural legacy of the past and geographical realities shaped the emerging diplomatic elites. The analysis presented in the thesis is based on a survey that I conducted. Several conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of diplomats in 27 countries. The composition of the emerging diplomatic elite across countries shows some striking similarities and some striking differences. The areas of important similarities are education, social origins and channels of recruitment. The differences mainly occur in age, gender, recruitment channels, previous professional experience, type of residence and additional jobs performed. Particularly illuminating in this respect is the division of respondents by geographical criterion into the CEE/FSU countries. A more meticulous analysis shows that the revolutionary political transformations were not followed by a revolutionary transformation of elites, or of diplomatic elites in particular. There was a modest degree of circulation from the lower classes into the elite role (in particular, into the diplomatic elite), but it did not transcend the socially desirable and socially stabilising moderate level. It was certainly not a revolutionary degree of circulation into the diplomatic elite. Nor was there a full-scale reproduction of elites."

Drawing on extant research on Eastern Enlargement this study develops an approach of &lsquo;theoretical differentiation&rsquo; and distinguishes between rationally oriented &lsquo;Utility Maximizing&rsquo; entrants (UM) and constructively driven &lsquo;Value Maximizing&rsquo; countries (VM). &lsquo;Theoretical differentiation&rsquo; in elite attitudes then, becomes the default drive in empirically investigating public support for the EU. First, explaining the dynamics of utilitarian public attitudes, this study &lsquo;differentiates&rsquo; the short- term, economic factors from the long-term, elite-driven stimuli that render the UM group of countries more eurosceptic than the VM group. The regression analysis shows that while in both groups short-term support fluctuates with the business cycle, the intensity of long-run support is determined by the set of structural characteristics that identify them as either UM or VM. Similarly, &lsquo;differentiation&rsquo; in affective support shows that the latter is a mixture of the longterm disposition towards EU, determined by historical elite attitudes, and the current socialization factors that govern short-run variations. Yet, the affective attitudes of the two groups not only differ in their mean levels of support (i.e. intensity) but also in their responses to direct and indirect socialization stimuli (i.e. fluctuations). In other words, EU enlargement politics and the distinct elite frames they produce increase the stickiness of affective attitudes to European integration and partially regulate the utilitarian public sentiment. Both utilitarian and affective models of EU public opinion were tested at the aggregate level of survey respondents, using Eurobarometer polls from the fifteen &lsquo;old&rsquo; member states. OECD data were compliled to control for the economic factors, while original data on the national distribution of EU officials in the Commission and the European Parliament were gathered by the author to control for the EU socialization stimuli."

Le postulat de d&eacute;part a &eacute;t&eacute; de soutenir que la modernit&eacute; constitue un concept central mais apor&eacute;tique pour rendre compte des r&eacute;alit&eacute;s de la domination dans le monde d'aujourd'hui. Ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne anthropologico-historique d&eacute;terminant mais refoul&eacute; dans les sciences sociales et dans la philosophie, l'esclavage constitue une forme d'antinomie moderne qui permettrait de combler ce vide s&eacute;mantique. Si l'on peut ais&eacute;ment concevoir la modernit&eacute; comme un &laquo; miroir invers&eacute; &raquo; par rapport &agrave; l'esclavagisme antique, l'analyse socio-historique des esclavages en Occident, fait appara&icirc;tre d'encombrantes contradictions. Au centre de celles-ci, figure la mise en place d'un &laquo; capitalisme esclavagiste &raquo; du XVe au XIXe si&egrave;cle entre l'Europe, l'Afrique et les Am&eacute;riques. Tenir compte de cette exp&eacute;rience historique irr&eacute;ductible, oblige &agrave; reconna&icirc;tre que la fin de cet esclavagisme constitue une condition sine qua non de l'av&egrave;nement de la modernit&eacute; politique et &eacute;conomique en Occident. La deuxi&egrave;me partie de la th&egrave;se entend montrer que la modernit&eacute; peut &ecirc;tre approfondie par la construction du concept moderne et critique de &laquo; servitude volontaire &raquo; et cela &agrave; partir de l'oeuvre d'&Eacute;tienne de La Bo&eacute;tie. Comment est-il possible de se retrouver &agrave; la fois libre et asservi ? Quelles sont les raisons qui poussent &agrave; consentir &agrave; une tyrannie ? Comment la libert&eacute; peut-elle se m&eacute;tamorphoser en esclavage ? La servitude volontaire appara&icirc;t comme une interrogation majeure qui transcende la th&eacute;orie politique et la th&eacute;orie de la subjectivit&eacute;. Elle ouvre ainsi tout un champ de questions in&eacute;dites sur notre modernit&eacute; contemporaine. La troisi&egrave;me partie vise &agrave; d&eacute;montrer que l'esclavage et la servitude volontaire constituent des outils interpr&eacute;tatifs pertinents pour analyser la r&eacute;alit&eacute; du travail soumis aux conditions actuelles du capitalisme. Pour cela, la th&egrave;se rappelle dans un premier temps qu'il ne peut exister de modernit&eacute;, dans ses dimensions politique, &eacute;conomique et sociale, sans la constitution d'un droit du travail effectif qui prot&egrave;ge la personne humaine de la servitude. Analyser cette centralit&eacute; du travail et du droit dans la modernit&eacute; conduit en outre &agrave; reconna&icirc;tre l'importance de la subjectivit&eacute;. A l'instar de la psychodynamique du travail de Christophe Dejours, cette proposition moderne implique de consid&eacute;rer qu'&laquo; un pur travail d'ex&eacute;cution n'existe pas &raquo; et que tout travail mobilise l'intelligence du sujet. A partir de cette reconstruction de la modernit&eacute;, la th&egrave;se se poursuit de mani&egrave;re transdisplinaire pour montrer que &laquo; le nouvel esprit du capitalisme &raquo; (Luc Boltanski et Eve Chiapello) peut &ecirc;tre interpr&eacute;t&eacute; comme une id&eacute;ologie de la servitude volontaire. Le ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne de management (&agrave; la fois discours et pratique) est ici le point-cl&eacute; des discussions pour comprendre les &eacute;volutions du capitalisme et les transformations du travail. Le consentement &agrave; la servitude volontaire, s'il peut s'observer &agrave; travers les nouveaux dispositifs de redisciplinarisation des travailleurs, il ne peut en revanche s'expliquer qu'&agrave; partir de la clinique du travail, c'est &agrave; dire &agrave; travers l'&eacute;tude &eacute;tiologique des pathologies mentales et psychosomatiques, des suicides et tentatives de suicide en rapport au travail. Enfin, le rapport entre capitalisme contemporain et servitude volontaire, s'il constitue une centralit&eacute;, n&eacute;cessite cependant d'&ecirc;tre nuanc&eacute;. La servitude involontaire, reconnue internationalement par le droit sous les termes de &laquo; formes contemporaines d'esclavage &raquo; ou de &laquo; travail forc&eacute; &raquo;, existe toujours tant au centre qu'en p&eacute;riph&eacute;rie du dit-syst&egrave;me.

Nevertheless, the influence of inter-branch negotiations on the EC/EU&rsquo;s international actorness4 still remains a gray area between law and political science. An under-explored aspect regards the distribution of competences &ndash; defined as authority to undertake negotiations with third states and international organizations &ndash; within the Community institutional framework. Such competences, or powers, may be exclusive to member states (MSs), exclusive to the EC represented by the Commission, or shared by both. The last situation, known as mixed participation (or mixity) is the key variable of this study. This thesis seeks to shed light on EU actorness under mixity conditions by investigating how and to what extent the distribution of competences between the European Commission and the Council of Ministers influences the performance of the EC in the negotiation of certain types of global environmental agreements. The methodology consists of comparative analysis of three empirical cases related to the exploitation of living marine resources (fisheries). A two-level approach grounded in rational choice institutionalism is adopted, dividing the study in two main parts: the first focuses on EU level bargains (L1) in order to explain the different kinds of contracts (mandate) established between the Council and the Commission through a principal-agent relationship. The independent variables taken into account are Council‟s preferences, Commission&rsquo;s preferences, and the extent of the knowledge about ecological processes impacted by the forthcoming policy decisions stemming from the agreements. This last variable was called &bdquo;environmental scientific uncertainty‟ (ESU), as this term is already used by environmental economists. The second part of the thesis addresses the negotiation of global agreements to which the EC was part, either exclusively or together with MSs. As there is a shift in the level of analysis the mandate &ndash; the dependent variable at L1 &ndash; becomes an independent variable at L2. The goal is now to explain: a) the effects of mixity as opposed to EC exclusive competence on the EU&rsquo;s actorness. The underlying argument is that the implications of mixity go beyond European integration; in fact they are critical to the strengthening of EU agency vis-&agrave;-vis other players. They appear as a valuable institutional mechanism in domains marked by scarcity of reliable scientific data about ecological processes (as in ESU). The three cases are studied in both L1 and L2 and relate to fisheries policies: a) the Agreement to Promote Compliance by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas (1995), under the FAO framework; b) the Agreement on Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (1995), Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) framework and c) The Jakarta Mandate, an agreement on Biodiversity of Marine and Coastal Areas (1995), under the Convention on Biological Diversity framework. Data stem mainly from Law databases and official journals.

Exploring the domestic dimension of these countries&rsquo; accession provides insights into policy-making, party strategies, and party interaction in the post-communist context. The key objective of the project is to examine a number of factors inspired by the Western experience that drive the responses of political parties in regard to European integration. More specifically, the relevance of parties&rsquo; (1) ideology, (2) relations to electorates, and (3) interactions within the party system make the purpose of investigation here. First, the role of ideology is scrutinised across the CEE region using statistical methods as well as a combination of party manifestos and expert survey data. The main conclusion to be drawn from the CEE analysis is that parties&rsquo; ideological makeup represents a necessary yet insufficient consideration for how parties react to Europe. Therefore, the thesis suggests that in order to arrive at a more compelling explanation of parties&rsquo; EU attitudes, the importance of electoral links and competition for office needs to be factored into the discussion, alongside political ideology. Given a series of methodological constraints and opportunities, the dynamic interaction between these three factors in influencing parties&rsquo; European stances is assessed in the case of Romania. This in-depth study relies on secondary literature, different opinion polls, and qualitative information from various party and media materials in order to map five Romanian political parties ideologically, establish their party-type, and review their European orientations. The overall conclusion of the Romanian case study is that only the interplay between the three features - parties&rsquo; ideology, their relationship with voters, and inter-party strategies - can offer a reliable guide to the positions adopted by political parties toward EU integration."

Two main issues were studied: a) how individuals in the agencies talk about &ldquo;working together&rdquo; and b) how individuals construct the roles of the EU agencies. The research brought to the fore a variety of interpretative repertoires concerning the notion of &ldquo;working together&rdquo; and the role of the agencies. Furthermore, the variation that was observed was shown to parallel scientific discourses about Europe and culture, as well as the more specialised literature on the EU agencies. In this way, both the lay and the scientific discourses were structured on similar arguments. Thus, it was shown that scientific discourse informs and is informed by lay discourse, a finding that is consistent with a discursive psychology approach. However, the analysis also identified innovative discourses that are emerging in an attempt to transcend the ideological dilemmas that pervade both the lay and the scientific discourses. In this connection, one of the major claims advanced in this dissertation is that focusing on the norms and expectations produced in an agency&rsquo;s organisational setting through statistical techniques as well as the qualitative analysis of the agencies&rsquo; everyday discourses can provide illuminating insights on questions such as identity, culture and issues of political power which are extremely pertinent to the broader European integration process."

Closely tied to the notion of national identity and a core competence of the Nation State, migrant integration policy is a field where the Member States should have displayed an insurmountable degree of reluctance to act collectively at the EU level. In the early 2000s, the Member States nonetheless chose to place this highly sensitive issue on the European agenda and to take some common initiatives in this area. In light of these considerations, the dissertation aims to explain the introduction of cooperation in the field of integration and its nature&mdash;the soft mode of governance and the type of integration policy informing the cooperation. Inspired by the Strategic-Choice Approach and Liberal Intergovernmentalism, I analyze these different aspects through a two-stage explanatory framework that focuses both on the national and EU level. The first stage considers the preferences formation process in the Member States&mdash;that is, their preferences for the cooperation and its specific features; I focus in particular on the cases of Sweden and the Netherlands. The second stage is concerned with the negotiation process between the Member States with respect to the substance and instruments of cooperation in this field. Specifically, I analyze the negotiations of two Council Conclusions, which took place in 2004 and 2011 respectively. I demonstrate how policy divergence between national integration policies have acted as a driver for Member States to engage in cooperation at the EU level. I further document how national politics not only influence the preferences of the Member States for the nature of the EU cooperation, but also explain the outcome of successive negotiations."

My cases are policy areas, which have been selected on the basis of their salience in Member States. The case of high salience is employment policy and the case of low salience is anti-poverty policy. Regarding the European level, the thesis seeks to identify the main causal factors that determine the development of the OMC. I use an adapted version of the Principal-Agent framework, where the Member States represent the Principal(s) and the European Commission represents the Agent. While most existing literature analyses the OMC at one moment in time, I analyse how the OMC develops through time, where I distinguish between emergence, when it has not been fully established, and evolution, when it has been fully established as a policy coordination instrument. I develop two hypotheses to test Commission-Member State interaction during OMC development during emergence and evolution and two to test if their interaction differs in cases of high and low saliency. My findings show that the Commission has a greater influence during the emergence of the OMC and that the Member States have more influence during the evolution of the OMC. The saliency of a policy issue only minimally influences Member State and Commission interaction in the two cases. For the national level, the thesis seeks to shed some light on how and the extent to which the OMC has been integrated into the domestic contexts of (14) EU Member States. The endeavour is first to draw some general conclusions about how governmental and non-governmental actors in Member States use the OMC. My findings show that it has mainly been used as a policy reporting instrument, but has in some cases also been used for policy development. The aim is secondly to assess the extent to which the general objectives of the OMC have been achieved. My findings show that it does not define core reform programmes in Member States, which is hardly surprising, since the OMC is a soft policy instrument."

The EU&rsquo;s discourse presents this phenomenon as an external aggressor that is taking advantage of the free circulation and establishment entailed by the Single Market, of the globalization in general and of technological advances in particular. European societies, on the other hand, are understood as helpless victims, as their traditional responses are no longer able to cope with the recently acquired transnational dimension of organized crime. Following this reasoning, the EU has been developing protection mechanisms- in order to safeguard the citizens and the society in general against organized crime-, based on a so- called common understanding of this phenomenon. Because of this effort, it has been possible to witness the strengthening of police and judicial cooperation, the development of comprehensive strategies and programmes, and the creation of new bodies and working groups to face this problem, all in the name of a greater efficiency. This trend has gradually been accentuated through the introduction of new legislation and the pressure of particular events such as the Falcone and Borsellino assassinations in 1992 and the high- profile terrorist attacks of 2001, 2004 and 2005. The outcome of this process has been the setting up of a complex structure made of numerous repressive and preventive instruments, where law enforcement agencies have gained increased powers and the emphasis has been put on security rather than on the liberty of European citizens. Bearing this background in mind, this research project aims at understanding how organized came to be considered by the European Union as such a serious threat. Departing from a social constructivist approach, it wishes to gain a deeper knowledge of the European Union&rsquo;s understanding of organized crime and to underline its constructed character. In particular, the project attempts to look into the securitization of organized crime through the specific cases of three EU agencies: Europol, Eurojust and Frontex. The Copenhagen School&rsquo;s theoretical background, together with discourse analysis, are used to trace how each of these three institutions contributed to the securitization of organized crime and the constitution of the current discourse on organized crime."

In face of the recurrence of major emergencies both inside and outside the EU borders, EU governments agreed in 2001 to set up a system which would allow them to pool their resources. The Council Decision of 2001 created the Community Civil Protection Mechanism (CCPM) relying on the so-called Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC), as the crisis centre for civil protection located in Brussels at the European Commission. In 2005, another major step was made regarding EU emergency management, with the creation of the Emergency and Crisis Coordination Arrangements (CCA). These arrangements, which are legally dealt with by the Council, were developed to share information, ensure coordination and collective decision-making at EU level in an emergency. It is dealt with by the Joint Situation Centre (SitCen). These two new organizational structures of EU emergency management, the MIC and the SitCen, and the two new organizational architectures of EU emergency management (commission- and council- based) are the object of my research. I address the question of their creation, adoption and implementation, developing a sociological neo-institutionalist approach based on the concept of divergent isomorphism. Incorporating an agency aspect, I demonstrate thanks to the use of the process-tracing method that new EU organizational structures emerged in an institutional context of fight for legitimacy: On the one hand, EU officials relying on input-legitimacy based on the isomorphically copied model; On the other hand, national officials relying on output-legitimacy drawn from their actions during crises. Thus, I contribute to the development of both EU integration theory in the field of security and organizational theory in the field of emergency management."

Contrary to widely held claims that immigration policies in Europe become more and more restrictive - the well-known debate on 'Fortress Europe' - Greek legislation on entry, residence and rights of third-country nationals has undergone gradual liberalising developments. This paradox drove my inquiry into the factors, institutions and processes that may explain liberalising immigration policy change for a period of fifteen years (1990 - 2005). Greece, similarly to the rest of southern European 'new' immigration countries, is often charged with the implicit or explicit assumption that its recent turn into a host country for immigrants makes her receptive to the restrictive influence of EU policies on immigration. Is that so? What impact, if any, has cooperation on immigration issues at the EU level had on Greek immigration policy developments and why? What form has it taken, under what conditions, and what mechanisms have been at work? In search for answers, my research combines a qualitative single-country case-study with the comparative method. The lens of analysis is put on Greek immigration policy making and change across domestic institutions and policy areas. Rules and regulations on entry and residence of third-country nationals for employment purposes and family reunification are process-traced and compared across the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary. At a second stage the same policy area is compared to other fellow areas, namely student immigration, ethnic immigration, and citizenship. The study draws on a variety of primary sources, including parliamentary debates, administrative documents, Court rulings and EU documentation. Policy developments taking place in other EU member-states are also kept in sight on the basis of the available secondary literature. Greek immigration policy has relied on institutional and policy continuities to a greater extent than one might imagine when thinking of 'new' immigration countries. The latter are far from a 'tabula rasa' in migration issues and their previous rules, regulations, and domestic institutional legacies should be taken into consideration in order to understand their immigration policies at present. A series of Greek restrictive regulations and practices concerning immigration controls had been rooted before 'Fortress Europe' was developed. At the same time, however, Greece lacked a regulatory framework for immigrant settlement - including attention at immigrant integration. This provided for incompatibilities with the developing set of common EU norms on the rights of legally resident third-country nationals, which caused significant EU pressures for national policy change. The on-going process of integration in immigration issues at the EU level affected the timing and the direction of domestic policy-making but the extent and degree of this effect across policy areas and domestic institutions have been differential. Greek participation in the common EU immigration policy alone cannot account for all European effects on national immigration policy. Nevertheless, it has been the most powerful institutional framework to induce or facilitate liberalising changes in the Greek immigration legislation in the last two decades. These findings support a reconsideration of the nature, policy dynamics and limitations of 'Fortress Europe', and they invite for further research in the rest of the EU member states."

The focus of the research is particularly on the impact of the Europeanization process on urban policy networks. The study is based on a comparative analysis of two European cities, Krakow and Glasgow. In particular, the thesis looks into the impact of EU funds on local actor relations around economic development by analysing the management of EU programmes, participation in EU projects and international city cooperation. The theoretical framework provided is based on analysing five dimensions of the Europeanization process, categorised as institutional, financial, cognitive, rhetoric and symbolic. The study builds on an extensive literature review and involved a range of sources, including a large number of interviews in both cities. The structure of the thesis is based on six main chapters. The first chapter introduces a research problem, puts forward preliminary hypotheses and sets a research design based on the five dimensions of the Europeanization process. In the second chapter we find a literature review, looking at actor relations around economic development in cities, with an emphasis on urban policy networks, and the conceptualised role of Europeanization stimulating cooperation among actors. Chapter three provides a review of the urban dimension in EU policies with respect to policy objectives, funding and policy measures. This is followed by two empirical chapters on Glasgow and Krakow, reviewing the historical, political and institutional contexts, management of EU programmes, participation in EU projects and engagement in inter-city cooperation. The final chapter links the empirical findings with urban theories and Europeanization literature as well as provides conclusions on the five dimensions set out in the theoretical framework. The dimensions of the Europeanization model set out in this dissertation demonstrate that when exposed to EU programmes, European cities tend to develop similar features of cooperation around EU funded economic development, despite their distinct institutional structures and differences in national, historical, cultural and political backgrounds. Similar institutions in the form of partnerships are created around EU funds (institutional dimension), which attract additional funds, both private and public (financial dimension). Actors involved with EU funded projects exchange knowledge and expertise that contribute to the creation of best practices, which become available to all cities in the European Union (cognitive dimension). Consequently, local actors involved with EU programmes start using the same EU language (rhetoric dimension) and apply the same EU symbols (symbolic dimension)."

Protest against 'Fortress Europe'","2008","MONFORTE, Pierre","Asylum, Right of -- European Union countries","This PhD dissertation concerns the processes of Europeanization of French and German associations mobilizing around the asylum issue. It seeks to analyse how these associations have been evolving since the start of the harmonisation of European asylum policies in the beginning of the 1990s. It focuses on a panel of associations (23 in total) representing the French and German pro-asylum movements. Their process of Europeanization is analysed through the examination of three fundamental dynamics: the Europeanization of their networks (the construction of inter-associative linkages across Europe), discourses (the construction of framing-processes having a European dimension) and collective actions (the construction of mobilizations addressing the European institutions). This thesis is situated at the intersection between three domains of research: social movements, European integration and migration policies studies. It aims to analyse a process of Europeanization 'from below' (as it concerns civil society actors) and 'from the margin' (as it concerns issues linked to the definition of its borders). Relying on an approach that is comparative (the analysis of France and Germany as different fields of mobilization on the asylum issue) and dynamic (the progressive definition of the EU level as a new field of mobilization), it analyses the question of knowing if associations having differentiated profiles and/or coming from different national contexts tend to have differentiated paths and degrees of Europeanization. Through the use of the concept of field of European mobilizations (associations constructing Europeanized collective actions evolve in a particular social space, defined by specific resources, rules and issues at stake), it shows that the Europeanization of social movement organizations corresponds to a process of inclusion into - and exclusion from - a particular field: that of the organizations gravitating around European institutions since the beginning of the 1990s. It shows then that associations having differentiated profiles and coming from differentiated national contexts follow a process of Europeanization from below, contesting the definition of EU borders that power-holders let prevail. They evolve in distinct fields of European mobilizations and use different resources and strategies to mobilize against EU asylum policy. Two main sources are used: semi-structured interviews and associative publications. The data collected was analysed through different methods developed in social movements studies: frame analysis, network analysis, protest-event analysis."

The case of race equality policy","2012","HERMANIN, Costanza",NA,"Ten years after its enthusiastic adoption in 2000, the Race Equality Directive (RED) - a deeply innovative and indeed overall far-reaching piece of equal treatment legislation &ndash; seems to be still little enforced at the level of European courts. Why? Neither a sudden retrenchment of race discrimination in Europe, nor the inaptitude of the policy to generate European Union (EU)-law litigation, can easily explain the scarce signs of the extensive judicial enforcement that characterise other EU equal treatment policies, such as those on EU-nationality, gender and age. This study zooms in on the realm of domestic politics and judicial enforcement to inquire into cross-sectional and cross-national variations in the implementation of EU equal treatment policy. To do so, I rely upon analytical tools developed by three branches of EU studies scholarship &mdash; Europeanization, compliance and judicial politics literature &mdash; and I apply them to the yet unexplored domain of race equality policy. Tracing the process of transposition, in the first place, and analysing case law databases and expert interviews with legal practitioners, in the second place, I inquire into compliance and judicial enforcement in three EU countries: France, Germany and Italy. The findings of this comparative study confirm a very limited judicial enforcement of the RED, especially as domestic patterns of adversarial litigation in the domain of race equality are concerned. I explain this divergence looking at the ‗containment&lsquo; action that domestic policymakers may exert on directives at the moment of transposition. In the case of the RED, this action crucially impinged on aspects likely to determine enforcement dynamics, such as those elements of the process regulating access to judicial redress. This work shows that in the case of a policy measure such as the RED, focused on individual judicial redress and mainly targeted towards disadvantaged end-users, the harmonization of some process elements is crucial to determining converging implementation dynamics. If Europeanization is contained at the moment of transposition, judicial enforcement can be seriously hindered at the national as well as the supranational levels even in presence of domestic legal mobilization. In addition to that, the thesis shows how limited raceconsciousness is to be found in contemporary European jurisprudence as well as in the claims filed by antidiscrimination law applicants."

The aim is to address some of the theoretical and empirical gaps in the rapidly developing but still emerging field of e-democracy. Moreover, the intention is to assist edemocracy practitioners in tailoring their projects in a way that addresses the particular democratic problems that they are facing. To this purpose, the thesis presents a theoretical frame and indicators to assess the quality of e-democracy projects. The quality is explored through in-depth comparison of five case studies of e-democracy initiatives in Italy, France, Sweden and the UK. Two types of projects are examined: epetitioning and parliamentary informatics (i.e. projects that enable citizens to monitor and engage in legislative activities of parliaments). The thesis provides primary survey evidence from nearly 700 e-democracy participants, as well as from interviews with project stakeholders. In focusing on e-democracy from the user perspective - rather than from the more common perspectives of policy-makers and data/tool providers - and in addressing standards of democratic quality, the thesis contributes to a rebalancing of the e-democracy debate towards civic, over structural and technological characteristics. The e-democracy projects at hand show that ICT improve access and usability of information, facilitate the interaction between citizens and civil society, and offer important stimuli for engagement. The projects manage to attract previously passive citizens and deepen engagement with those who are already involved in politics. However, the downside is that many of the traditionally under-represented groups in politics are even more absent from edemocracy platforms. Moreover, the projects stop short of establishing direct communication between citizens and their representatives, and of achieving policy impact. In fact, my findings confirm that ICT enable new dynamics but that the traditional political institutions remain change resistant. Rather than permitting a revolution, e-democracy contributes to a slow evolution of the political system."

How do politicians decide about the independence they give to regulatory agencies? 2. Is there a link between the amount of independence which an agency enjoys and the way in which it performs its tasks? The first question investigates the factors that lead politicians to delegate in the field of competition policy. The second question concerns, more broadly, the relationship between costs and benefits of delegation. This dissertation focuses on national competition authorities (NCAs) in the EU member states, being antitrust one of the few really &ldquo;European&rdquo; policies, enforced in the same way in all the countries by the European Commission and by the NCAs. The main empirical analysis (Chapter 3) tests a theoretical framework, based on both original hypotheses and previous contributions. In order to measure formal independence, an index based on several features of agency autonomy has been developed. The results confirm the two original hypotheses advanced in this work. On the one hand, the degree of independence of NCAs is influenced by political polarisation and by the presence of big firms in the national economy (the higher the polarisation, the higher the negative impact of big firms on independence). On the other hand, independence is related to EU membership: the longer the country has been member of the EU, the more independent the NCA is. These findings have been &ldquo;cross-checked&rdquo; with a series of interviews with expert and members of competition authorities in France, Italy, and Greece (Chapter 4). In Chapter 5, the hypothesis of a relationship between independence and performance has been tested. According to the results of this statistical analysis, greater formal independence leads competition authorities to investigate more cases and to issue more decisions."

Point of departure constitutes puzzling divergence in patterns of collaboration between these two countries. Cluster analysis conducted on unique set of quantitative data revealed that in Czech Republic significantly more nonprofits manifest ""strongly collaborative"" pattern than in Poland. Those nonprofits have particularly well developed collaborative ties to the government. Interestingly, close collaboration with government do not come at the expense of local ties and accountability to the citizens. Existing regional nonprofit literature has not captured national differences in this respect. Explaining this puzzling divergence constitutes the main goal of this thesis. Building on rational choice and sociological institutionalism I assume that two actors played a central role in shaping patterns of inter-organisational collaboration of nonprofits in Central Europe, i.e. domestic government, through its ""nonprofit policy"", and the European Union, through its main developmental instrument, European Union Structural Funds (""EU SF""). Based on the extensive literature review, analysis of secondary data and more than 50 semi-structured interviews conducted in Poland and Czech Republic I argue that divergence in patterns of collaboration is a consequence of differences in resources and opportunities provided to the nonprofit organizations by domestic governments and EU. Strong ties to the government of the significant part of Czech nonprofit sector are a consequence of relatively generous and centralised public funding available for those organizations, institutionalized opportunities for participation in policy making and activism of the nonprofit community in the pre-accession period. Weak collaborative ties of Polish nonprofits are a result of scarcity and decentralisation of public funds, very limited opportunities for shaping public policy and general distrust towards collaboration with government among the leaders of Polish nonprofit community as well as their limited activism during pre-accession period."

Since then, however, member states have decided to engage the EU in a larger number of counter-terrorist issues and, in some cases, empower it to undertake substantial tasks. The EU has thus become an important player in counterterrorism in Europe; notwithstanding the fact that the major actor remains the member states themselves. However, this increase in EU engagement on counter-terrorist issues has varied enormously from one policy area to another. This asymmetric increase lies at the centre of my research question: since 11 September 2001, why have member states conferred important anti-terrorist responsibilities to the EU in some areas - for instance, judicial cooperation in criminal matters - and less significant in others, such as policing? I address this question by investigating the agenda-setting and decision-making processes of two specific EU decisions in each of my two policy area cases (2001-2007). In each case, one decision constitutes a large increase of EU engagement and the other represents a small or zero increase. The two cases are: Judicial Cooperation (European Arrest Warrant and the European Evidence Warrant) and Police Cooperation (EU &lsquo;Pr&uuml;m Measure&rsquo; and failure of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal on the Principle of Availability). In order to explain the research puzzle, I apply a modified version of John Kingdon&rsquo;s &lsquo;Three Strands Model.&rsquo; This enquiry sheds light on the relative influence on decision-making of the occurrence or non-occurrence of a major terrorist attack (i.e. changes in the addressed problem) and the entrepreneurship of the European Commission or of the member state holding the rotating Presidency of the EU Council. The EU member states are the central actors and their preferences are analysed as a means to understand the role played by the logic of consequentialism and the logic of appropriateness, respectively."

Further, protracted delays and outright resistance was often exercised in the face of - or in spite of - EU membership conditionality as well as US financial assistance and sanctions. The period of assessment is post-2000, after the fall of both the Milosevic regime in Serbia and the Tudjman regime in Croatia. The key research questions are: How do we best explain the changing pattern of ICTY cooperation and compliance in Post-Milosevic Serbia and Post- Tudjman Croatia? How was it that governments sometimes complied, while at other times resisted cooperation with the ICTY? The Serbian and Croatian cases provide a challenge for conventional IR assumptions regarding the practice of political influence (international theory), the meaning of political compliance (conceptualization) and the study of political action (methodology). Each of these theoretical dimensions is discussed in the opening chapters for the purpose of developing better analytical tools to study influence-making and compliance in international politics. Subsequently, the story of ICTY compliance in Serbia and Croatia is then explored in empirical chapters which identify political facets involved in the making of ICTY justice and ICTY compliance."

In the light of the post-revolutionary elections in Egypt and Tunisia, Islamist parties are sweeping the polls supported by the overwhelming majority of voters. This dissertation investigates the dynamic of this support for the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. The explanation of individual activists&rsquo; motivation behind this form of middle-class activism has been investigated by exploring individual beliefs, emotions and identities. Activists&rsquo; motivational explanations and representation do not develop in a vacuum, outside of a specific context. Explaining the configuration of collective action therefore requires an analysis of a pattern of social characteristics using a spectrum of social movement theories. The long-term contentious relationship between the various Egyptian authoritarian regimes and the Muslim Brotherhood produced an Islamist resistance culture with a particular set of incitements for would be activists. Middle-class activists have primarily been motivated by the Brotherhood&rsquo;s ability to educate its followers through a multi-stage membership process. During this process youth activists have acquired a strengthened sense of individual purpose. They also possess organizational skills and have successfully ascended the social ladder, leading to a feeling of moral superiority and a degree of personal autonomy even within an authoritarian sociopolitical context. The social movement organization serves as a facilitator of structured dissent and its success depends ultimately on its ability to recognize the basic needs of a frustrated population. Sympathizers of a particular social movement organization in turn seek realistic forms of dissent which correspond to their system of values and practices."

The phrase &lsquo;socio-political imaginary&rsquo; is used in the meaning given to it by Charles Taylor. According to the author, a social imaginary is the transformation of social theory into the profound normative notions and imagines that enable common people&rsquo;s practice of society. Applying this analytical tool to the study of an Islamic community allows the researcher to fill in a gap of time and space existing in the literature about Islamic movements. In terms of time, it allows the researcher to focus the investigation on a little theorized step in the process of mobilization by religious actors that is, the cognitive elaboration of a socio-political project before mobilization around that project is organized. In terms of space, it grasps the intermediate level of cognition existing between the theological elaboration on politics and society promoted by religious scholars and the masses&rsquo; practical knowledge of the social realm constituted by a set of instinctive beliefs and judgments. Finally, the concept of social imaginary allows the researcher to analyse discourse and practice as mutually sustaining elements that together define a social actor&rsquo;s function and position in society. Unravelling this dynamic interaction means going back and forth, both temporally and cognitively, between imagination and acts and recognizing that the discourse in itself can be influenced by the social space for which it provides a map."

It shows also how ideas about gender shape transnational family migration patterns, and affect the individual family life of transmigrants. And eventually, it examines the social and family-related consequences of these processes. The research questions have been formulated as follows: How do gender role beliefs and family gender arrangement (gender practice, family gender organization) affect transnational family migration? And how are gender role beliefs and family gender arrangements affected by transnational family migration? It is crucial to stress that the answer to these questions will shed light on potential gender transitions, its directions, circumstances and social and familial consequences of transnational family migration. In order to explain the research problem from a dynamic perspective and distinguish various transnational family phases, I introduce three stages which I call  pre-transnational, transnational and post-transnational family stage. The pre-transnational stage refers in retrospect to the time of decision making process about migration, the transnational family stage is about the time of transnational family separation due to migration and the nature of family life during this time while the post-transnational family stage considers the time after family reunification which in my thesis is limited only to the reunification in Ireland.An important part of the thesis is a chapter that is dedicated to the role of Polish Church in Ireland and the correlation of migrant&rsquo;s religiosity and their gender roles."

While southern European societies can be described as family-centred or familialistic, northern Europeans are regarded as rather individualistic. This study shows that the departure of young people from the parental home is a key element in explaining these differences.  Young southern Europeans usually (not only since the recent economic crisis) leave the parental home later than their northern European peers. A thorough examination of the literature on this topic, including studies in sociology, geography, history, economics, anthropology, and psychology, reveals that this behavioural difference is not merely the result of favourable or unfavourable economic conditions. From open-ended interviews with university students and their parents in Italy and Germany (N=43), it was possible to reconstruct different social norms and opposed patterns of interpreting reality that support either the early residential independence of young people or their coresidence with parents. These socially shared patterns of interpretation concern various aspects of the transition to adulthood, such as the role of parents as advisors of their children; the preparation of young people for their future lives; and the expectations regarding meritocracy in the labour market. The interviews, furthermore, illustrate how these norms and meanings are transmitted from one generation to the next in the socialisation process.  Having their roots in the period before the Industrial Revolution, the different patterns of leaving home have considerably shaped northern and southern European societies over time. The study points out that residential independence during education and early career can be a source for innovation and social change as well as a triggering factor for economic growth and for the development of public welfare institutions."
"http://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/40985","Fertility in time of economic crisis : the Great Recession effects on childbearing in the United States","2016","COMOLLI, Chiara Ludovica",NA,"This dissertation addresses the effects of the Great Recession on childbearing, focusing in particular on how economic and employment insecurity affects the transition to first birth in the United States. Chapter II offers an in-depth macro analysis of the effect of the Great Recession on fertility rates in the United States and in Europe. The chapter goes beyond the standard analysis of the relationship between unemployment rates and total fertility rates by using other macroeconomic indicators, such as public debt risk and an economic policy uncertainty index. Results show a strong negative correlation between such indicators and birth rates both in Europe and in the United States.  Chapters III and IV investigate micro-level childbearing dynamics in the US, and the mechanisms linking employment insecurity and the transition to first birth. They further address the link between macroeconomic indicators of the crisis and individual demographic behaviors. Chapter III shows that the probability of having the first child depends on couples' employment dynamic and that, compared to dual earners, all working status combinations are detrimental for childbearing, including those couples where women are housewives. The income effect seems to explain the results, while I find no evidence of an opportunity cost mechanism at play. Chapter IV focuses on women and on the impact of intergenerational social mobility on the transition to the first birth. The findings confirm Easterlin's theory (1961, 1976) of resources and aspirations: during the crisis, American women become mothers earlier if they are socioeconomically non-downwardly mobile with respect to their parents. Finally, this thesis shows a negative effect of the crisis on the extensive margin of fertility for women close to the limits of biological fertility. The latter is a crucial result related to the debate on the temporary versus permanent effect of business cycles' fluctuations on fertility. Chapter V studies childless women close to the end of their reproductive life, for whom any further birth postponement is likely to slide into permanent childlessness. The analysis is based on a novel research design implemented in order to go beyond the associational analysis. A difference-in-difference estimate, applied to pseudo-cohorts of childless White American women, identifies the (positive) causal effect of the Great Recession on permanent childlessness."

Special attention is also drawn to the period of Sharon&rsquo;s mandate and the Al-Aqsa Intifada (2001-2005). The thesis has two main objectives. The first is to draw a clearer picture of the ways in which French and German foreign policy towards Israel- Palestine has been socially constructed. The second is to better understand the reasons why France and Germany, key powers at the heart of the EU, did not furnish the efforts required in order to broker a peace deal in the Middle East that lived up to their own - as well as the EU&rsquo;s - rhetoric and official 'dedication' to the conflict. First, I consider the respective processes of foreign policy making in France and Germany. After examining bilateral relations between France, Germany, Israel and the Palestinian Authority, I shed some light on the evolution of French and German national &lsquo;positions&rsquo; and identify those who have played an important role in shaping this process. Subsequently, I propose to evaluate how foreign policy makers and leaders eventually take decisions. I therefore highlight major domestic and external sources of influence, and study how foreign policy makers prioritise among conflicting interests and such influential factors. Finally, I suggest in what respect these actors gave, or failed to give, their national diplomacy a vision, a strategy and solid boundaries within which to work. At first sight, it might be said that the dominant role of the United States in the Middle East, combined with internal divisions in Europe, in large part explain the weakness of France, Germany and the EU in the Middle East diplomatic arena between 1998 and 2005. However, my research also specifically tests the hypothesis that the collective memory of the Holocaust, its contemporary use and its cultural domestic meaning, in both France and Germany, have been central and even decisive in the elaboration of their respective positions. The set of norms and values linked to collective memory and shared by key decision-makers has constituted a major paralysing factor. In other words, a sense of historical responsibility and of Israeli 'exceptionalism' has developed in France and Germany. This has shaped the perception of the conflict and prevented both countries, and the EU itself, from playing a more pro-active role in the peace negotiations. From a theoretical perspective, this research contributes to foreign policy analysis in the field of International Relations. In addition, the focus on the social construction of a particular foreign policy clearly places this research in the constructivist tradition. However, the thesis is not primarily designed as an argument in favour or against a particular approach. Neither is the conflict merely a &lsquo;case-study&rsquo;, aimed at highlighting the weaknesses of any pre-conceived theoretical concepts or tools. The objective is to demonstrate the ways in which a particular set of norms and values, both in France and in Germany, may exert a decisive influence at various stages of the foreign policy making process."

Their political discourse is based on a confrontational style of address, while their content is largely inspired by poststructuralist views of identities as a tool through which power operates (Butler, 1990). However, the 'constant deconstruction of identities&hellip; undermine[s] the claims to strength and unity of their own rights movement' (Jasper et al., forthcoming: 29). The anti-identity paradox (Jasper et al., forthcoming; or the 'queer dilemma', Gamson, 1995) entails the failure to avoid the construction of a new identity, built precisely on the same discourse it attempts to deconstruct. Thus, the following puzzle emerges: If we assume that queer politics are based on this 'anti-identity' paradox, on which kind of identity, then, can they mobilize? In other words, given that the identity they attempt to build leads to their selfdestruction, how can queer politics, over time, strengthen and spread across Europe?"

And does the extent of gender differences vary from country to country? Second, can conventional country groupings and countryspecific characteristics &ndash; family policies, the gender culture, and labor market related setups &ndash; contribute to the explanation of this country variation? To answer my research questions, I rely on comparative cross-sectional data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) from 2009 and 2013 and the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) from 2011/12. The main empirical analysis strategy is twostep multilevel models. I distinguish between a horizontal and a vertical dimension of gender differences in the labor market and examine several different indicators to offer a comprehensive picture of gender differences. At labor market entry, horizontal gender differences seem to be already pronounced in all countries, while my findings indicate that females are not yet disadvantaged in vertical gender inequalities (in terms of entering high-status occupations) in several countries. In turn, for the whole labor market population, I find a female disadvantage in working in supervisory positions and participating in employer-financed training in nearly all countries. Countries vary notably in the extent of their gender differences, indicating that countryspecific setups play a role. For horizontal gender differences at labor market entry, however, I can not identify a strong association with any of the theoretically important macro factors I examined: Neither the gender culture nor the share of women in public sector employment contributes notably to explaining country variation. In contrast, females seem to have better chances of entering high-status occupations and participating in employer-sponsored training in countries with family policies supporting females' full-time and continuous employment (i.e., shorter parental leave and higher childcare provision). I further identify a more traditional gender culture to be detrimental to women's chances of participating in employersponsored training. Finally, females disadvantage in entering high-status and supervisory positions is higher in countries with higher female employment."

There is currently a lack of consistent knowledge about what happens to those women who have reached the most influential positions of society, and about whether (and how) their situation differs from that of their male counterparts. This is particularly so in the case of political elites, about whom very few current studies exist. This thesis investigates gender and individual-level work/life outcomes among political elites (national parliamentarians) comparing two cases: Sweden and Germany. The research builds on empirical investigations from self-collected survey data covering finite populations of Swedish and German national parliamentarians. Parts of this political elite data are further matched to existing, large-scale databases from the European Social Survey, consisting of representative samples of general citizens, and of general elites, of the two nations. This allows reference comparisons to be made between the political elites and average citizens of the respective countries. To provide additional depth to the findings, the quan-titative investigation was also complemented by a qualitative interview study. The results showed gender inequality in the strength of demand and support experienced in the home-sphere of the political elites (such as concerning household work and functional partner sup-port). These gender discrepancies were more pronounced in the case of Germany than in Sweden. However, gender equality was observed concerning perceived career and influence possibilities in the work-sphere, and concerning general subjective well-being, in both the German and Swedish case of political elites."

Situating these terms in a concrete history of European post-colonial politics, the author shows how European policy has shifted from accepting responsibility for colonialism &ndash; constructed as it is on the paternalistic model of the gift &ndash; to a more amnesiac politics in which post-colonial countries are responsible for their own fate. In this way, Karagiannis illustrates that efficiency has become the overriding goal of development, and that the relationship between &lsquo;developed&rsquo; and &lsquo;developing&rsquo; countries is mainly defined by considerations pertaining to market capitalism."

Beginning with the 'Gnostic' systems of late Antiquity, the analysis follows 'lines of meaning' which extend through the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, right up to the present. From the long-term perspective which is thereby established, the spectre of a man-made nuclear apocalypse appears as the latest and most dramatic expression of an outlook on the human condition which refuses to accept limits in the imposition of human designs on the world. The paradoxical continuities that underlie the sense of epoch evoked by the end of the Cold War highlight this work's profound implications for our understanding of contemporary international politics."

Wolfensohn, former president of the World Bank, called corruption a cancer and declared a war against it, we have seen only partial victories. The phenomenon of corruption presents exceptional resilience in contemporary societies. Yet, empirical research shows that there are countries, regions, and cities that have been able to reverse their fate and managed to bring corruption under control. By taking up this issue, my doctoral thesis attempts to determine: a) the ways in which a negative (corrupt) institutional equilibrium can be reversed; and b) in areas of widespread corruption, why some cities and their politicians decide to opt out from corruption and to limit it. In order to do this, I explore a puzzling variety of levels of corruption across and within different levels of government (national, regional and local). I aim to explain why in some cities there is corruption, collusion and bad government, while in other cities within the same institutional framework we observe non-corruption and good government. In other words, I aim to explain institution-building in societies hampered by low levels of trust and fragmented interests, and to assess if the possibilities exist for corrupt cities to alter these negative tendencies and become &ldquo;good apples on bad trees"". I thus focus on well-performing cities in highly corrupt regions and countries, in an attempt to understand what lies behind the variation in levels of corruption between and within regions II argue that the answer to this question lies in the cost of corruption for government, combined with the capacity of the business sector to cooperate (business association strength) and press the government to invest in administrative capacity. I contend that business associations with the strong cooperation of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can press government, and that this, together with government stability, enables a shift from the government&rsquo;s short-term horizons to long-term investment in administrative capacity. In that way, government&rsquo;s potential &ldquo;grabbing hand"" can be limited. The methodology to probe this question is twofold: qualitative analysis using process tracing on eight cases of local government in Spain and Italy, and a historical analysis of the evolution of the economic circumstances and quality of government in these eight cases. My thesis contributes to the burgeoning literature on corruption and anti-corruption but also to the wider literature on political economy and collective action, by modeling endogenous institutional change and cooperation, even in the absence of trust and strong institutional control."

To this end, it draws on the wider comparative federalism literature to examine how basic federal political institutions structure the development of policy outcomes. The empirical focus is on the regulatory challenge posed by the internet's spectacular proliferation during the period of 1995-2005. Two hypotheses are formulated as to how basic federal political institutions shape the development of policy outcomes in the three polities under investigation. First, given the cross-border nature of the policy challenge, we expect to find similar interactions among the different levels of government in all three units of analysis. In particular, federal level political actors should be similarly mobilised into offering centralising solutions to problems with cross-border effects. Furthermore, this could provoke allocational shifts in authority towards the centre in the three units of analysis. Second, it is expected that differences in the policy process and the &lsquo;power capabilities&rsquo; of the centre help to explain the variance in policy outcomes. The main findings of the empirical investigation suggest that the dynamics of policymaking in the realm of internet regulation exhibit similarities that make EU comparison with other federal polities across these dimensions especially revealing. This is particularly the case when comparing the EU with polities characterised by an extremely decentralised federal configuration, institutionally weak centres, consensual modes of decision-making, and decentralised modes of policy implementation such as Switzerland."

Additionally, the transformation of industrial society into a knowledge-based one is raising the importance of knowledge management, regulation and creation. This doctoral research addresses collective action for knowledge-making in the digital era from a double perspective of organizational and political conflict through the case of global online creation communities. From the organizational perspective, it provides an empirically grounded description of the organizational characteristics of emerging collective action. The research challenges previous literature by questioning the neutrality of infrastructure for collective action and demonstrating that infrastructure governance shapes collective action. Importantly, the research provides an empirical explanation of the organizational strategies most likely to succeed in creating large-scale collective action in terms of the size of participation and complexity of collaboration. From the political conflict perspective, this research maps the diverse models of governance of knowledge-making processes, addresses how these are embedded in each model of governance, and suggests a set of dimensions of democratic quality adapted to these forms. Importantly, it provides an empirically grounded characterization of two conflicting logics present in the conditions for collective action in the digital era: a commons versus a corporate logic of collective action. Additionally, the research sheds lights on the emerging free culture and access to knowledge movement as a sign of this conflict. In hypothesizing that the emerging forms of collective action are able to increase in terms of both participation and complexity while maintaining democratic principles, this research challenges Olson&rsquo;s assertion that formal organizations tend to overcome collective action dilemmas more easily, and challenges the classical statements of Weber and Michels that as organizations grow in size and complexity, they tend to create bureaucratic forms and oligarchies. This research concludes that online creation communities are able to increase in complexity while maintaining democratic principles. Additionally, in the light of this research, the emerging collective action forms are better characterized as hybrid ecosystems which succeed by networking and combining several components, each with differens degrees of formalization and organizational and democratic logics."

Why does it matter that individuals have the ability to speak their mind uninhibited? What inherent value can be found in the seeking, receiving and imparting of information that would cause any society to raise it to the level of a human right? And why should the story and its subsequent narration in modern liberal thought raise the value of free expression to a value worth dying for? Why does speech matter? This thesis explores the governance of freedom of expression on the Internet. It focuses on liberal democracies and global corporations in North America and Europe, analyzing governance practices rather than norms or discourses. The thesis also studies developments in Internet technology, which it is argued increase the disciplinary capacity of technical Internet architecture. The thesis suggests that the Internet has seen the rise of innovative governance practices that influence how the Internet is regulated. From contesting code to algorithmic regulation and quasi-public NGOs, many novel governance practices can be observed by studying how the Internet is governed. Indeed it can be argued that Internet Governance is itself a forum for international regulatory debates on the nature of appropriate regulation in a globalized world. Finally, an argument is developed which suggests that a 'global default' of Internet speech restriction has developed in the last two decades. This global default is at the core of many disagreements in Global Internet Governance, but at the same time can only be understood in an international context. That such a system could even be developed internationally has required specific forms of global governance, termed here 'legitimacy theatre.' This phenomenon serves to ensure weak institutionalization and minimal state involvement while enabling extensive coordination between private actors. These factors all contribute to creating the Internet as we know it today and help in understanding what can be said and what is hidden or excluded from the most important human communications platform."

The thesis analyses discourses about immigrants and immigration by relevant policy-makers as well as types of immigrant integration policy. The thesis is based upon a comparison (longitudinal and across-cities) of the capital of Ireland - a city of recent immigration - and the capital of Austria, a city with a long history of immigration. These contrasting cases, which at the same time exhibit similar positions within their two nation states and within the global setting, allow an examination of the processes of convergence, as well as a scrutiny of the particularities of European cities in the domain of immigrant integration. The thesis argues that an analysis of both discourses and policies contributes to a more accurate understanding of the dynamics of immigrant integration in the urban space. The majority of research on immigrant integration in cities focuses solely on policies. This research tends to depict cities as an inclusive and liberal arena in contrast to the nation state. Cities, indeed, differ from nation states. The nation state and national citizenship are institutions that are based on principles of social closure and the notion of the imagined community. Rights and resources are widely accessible to its members, while this is not necessarily the case for others. Cities, in contrast, are potentially more predisposed to welcoming strangers. One becomes a member of the city by the fact of residence, and loses membership automatically by giving up residence. To a certain degree, the research findings of the thesis challenge this idea of the open city. It is shown that cities are clearly embedded in the national categorisations of boundary-making and are constrained by institutional mechanisms located at the nation-state level. Local governments are not only pragmatic actors which have to deal with the problems of integration on the ground. This thesis demonstrates that urban immigrant integration policies are led by cost and benefit considerations of policy actors confronted with global economic competition. Moreover, the policies of the cities as well as the discourses about immigrants are led by ideas such as the collective memory of a city and cross-city travelling concepts of immigrant integration. Urban responses to immigrants are also driven by institutional factors such as the make-up of the welfare regime and the electoral and party systems. Political party competition in particular is a relevant factor, substantially shaping both discourses and policies."

The thesis draws on data from four countries &ndash; Britain, France, Ireland and Spain &ndash; over the past 15 years of electoral politics. The thesis provides a comparative and longitudinal analysis of their strategies of politicisation and of depoliticisation in relation with the parties? different statuses within their party systems (incumbent, mainstream opposition and peripheral opposition) and in three distinct arenas (national elections, European elections and EU referendums). It investigates how these parties have handled EU issues in three complementary dimensions of their activities: in their strategies of political communication, in intra-party debates over the EU and in their responses to the consolidation of the European electoral arena. The thesis uses a mix-method approach based on claims-making analysis, thick qualitative comparisons and descriptive statistics. Contradicting the idea of a gradual europeanisation, it first provides evidence for the stable marginalisation and nationalisation of EU affairs. Second, while the rise of euroscepticism is often discussed, the thesis demonstrates that conflicts over EU matters are rarely prominent in practice, and that they remain sporadic and confined to certain electoral channels, with mainstream parties actively compartmentalising the potential divisive effects of EU issues within their organisations. Third, it points to the centrality of the twofold behaviour of opposition parties, explaining why the politicisation of EU matters has remained contextual and less linked to the role of radical parties than is usually recognised. It finally delineates a process of increasing seclusion between the national and European political arenas that can be observed through the trajectories of MEPs careers in relation to their domestic political spaces or through the disengagement of national parties from campaigning in EU elections."

Acknowledging space as a central tool of domination used by the Israeli authorities, the following question arises: how is space mobilized by those opposing this control? This thesis endeavours to shed light on the way in which space can become both a resource for and an outcome of protest, with an emphasis placed on the way it is used in and produced through practices of resistance. This research will utilise a comparative approach, relying on material collected in the course of fieldwork conducted between 2012 and 2014 in Israel and Palestine. The three ""sites of contention"" analysed here include the H2 area in Hebron (the Old City under Israeli authority), the ""core"" neighbourhoods of Silwan (Wadi Hilwe and al-Bustan) and the unrecognized Bedouin village of al- Araqib, in the Negev desert. Through the prism of these three case studies, the thesis will tackle different strategies built around the materiality of space, place, sense of place, territory, landscape, network and scale. We will see that beyond the struggle against occupation and discrimination, the protests also attempt to re-appropriate the local space and make territorial claims in multiple ways and at different scales. It appears that place is the fundamental spatiality used in the contention in each of the three cases: inhabiting the place, and affirming one's attachment to the neighbourhood is considered to be one of the only viable strategies available. This attachment, or sense of place, is connected to the attachment to the land, and to a territory, conceived in light of nationalist, religious and cultural perspectives. Through place-based practices and representations, but also via international advocacy, the actors of contention attempt to affirm the everlasting Palestinian rooting in space, thus challenging the deterritorialization provoked by the Israeli measures of control."

Its aim is twofold: on the one hand to elucidate the mechanisms of caste in social life and in particular, to analyse how ex-untouchables negotiate caste stigma, and on the other, to explore the caste, gender, and youth dimensions of the Ravidassia community in Catalonia, Spain. This study is comparative in nature, discussing caste, the management of caste stigma, and the Ravidassia sociocultural/religious movement in the Punjab, India and Catalonia, Spain. The Ravidassia community is an interesting case study for the study of caste, because the Ravidassias are the most important former untouchable group demographically in both the Punjab and in the diaspora. They have also become in the postwar period one of India&acute;s most economically and socially assertive &acute;Scheduled Caste&acute; or SC caste groups, an assertion which is articulated symbolically in the field of religion. The Ravidassias are thus an excellent example of a transnational group whose diaspora status is playing a key role in changing the caste status quo in their native Punjab. In focusing on the individual experience of caste stigma, this thesis seeks to highlight an aspect of caste discrimination that is frequently overlooked in debates on &acute;casteism&acute;, and to reveal how Dalits who are now educated and middle-class still struggle with the legacy of untouchability. During the course of my research, a significant portion of the global Ravidassia community, including the Spanish Ravidassia community, chose to break with Sikhism and form a completely autonomous religious identity. I thus had the privilege to witness a profound identity shift on the part of my interviewees which has seen new forms of caste pride emerge that would have been unthinkable only a generation ago. This ethnographic study reveals that while caste prejudice/stigma has not diminished with migration, caste as institution and social organisation has assumed new forms that can be strategically used by those who were once completely crushed by the caste system."

Which of the many entities within in the EU, among Brussels-based institutions and in member states, do they approach and how? How can the modalities of engagement be explained? What patterns emerge and how and why do they change over time? In answering these questions, the thesis provides insights on three under-researched issues of international relations: first, on how outsiders engage with the EU and whether the EU is capable of managing requests from the outside; second, on how China makes its EU policy, and, by extension, to what extent its decision-making structure can deal with complex foreignpolicy challenges; third, and more generally, on how international actors interact through numerous contacts among the bureaucratic agents within them. To reach these goals, a new analytical framework is introduced that distinguishes three processes to explain such transnational bureaucratic interaction. First, the decisionmaking in China on how to engage the EU. Second, the reception this approach receives on the EU side. These first two processes are analysed as based on the interplay of organisational logic, bureaucratic politics, and the degree of central control. Third, there are independent dynamics of direct interaction between bureaucratic entities, which result from the quality of personal relations and the matches or mismatches in preferences, worldviews, and perceptions. Two intensive case studies are performed, one on China&rsquo;s efforts to be recognised as a market economy by the EU, and another on the Chinese push to have the EU lift its arms embargo against China. The thesis proposes a threefold argument. First, due to complex formal rules and volatile informal patterns of EU foreign policy, the EU remains difficult to approach for third actors and is incapable of managing requests from the outside. Second, engaging a complex counterpart like the EU puts strain on the foreign-policy process. Chinese policy making suffers from strong horizontal divisions which prevent the distribution of expertise and hinder the formation of elaborate strategies for approaching the EU. Lastly, in order to explain the modalities of interaction between different actors in international affairs, it is crucial to look at how the bureaucratic agents involved in the foreign-policy process interact with their respective counterparts."

Drawing on the human rights and urban politics literature, this research provides a first comprehensive overview of human rights discourses, laws and institutions enacted by municipalities against the background of conflicts and tensions between cities&rsquo; economic and security priorities and the many social questions and problems generated by the increasing differentiation of local populations. Within this broad and unified theoretical framework, this study looks also at the differences emerging from local human rights policies that can now be found in very different areas of the world. Private and public actors - from individual experts and NGOs to cities (and their networks) and international organizations - act as policy agents diffusing human rights among cities. While often relying on a human rights framework, in fact most of these policies implement anti-discrimination measures, focusing on formal and/or substantial discrimination in both its individual or collective dimension. In order to respond to the main research question, this thesis employs a most different case type of comparison addressing the policies and institutions of two cities - New York and Barcelona - with special attention paid to the fields of employment and housing. The human rights polices of the two cities differ in many respects but also present some similarities. In New York, the core of the policy is the City Commission on Human Rights, one of the many local anti-discrimination agencies present in US cities. The Commission implements the city&rsquo;s Human Rights Law. The Commission has operated under the 'umbrella' of the US civil rights legal and political framework. In Barcelona, human rights are 'pushed' by the City Department on Civil Rights and its two bodies: the Office for Non Discrimination, which is an antidiscrimination agency modeled on the US type of civil rights agency, and the Inter-religious Center of Barcelona dealing with religious communities. Different aspects of the politics and law of human rights in the two cities are considered, from ethnic discrimination tied to migration to gay, lesbian and transgender issues. The thesis shows different approaches in the implementation of the human rights policies and different degrees of visibility and effectiveness by the city departments in advancing their human rights agenda. The comparison of the 'law enforcement' and 'law support' work of the Commission and the Office for Non Discrimination shows similarities in issues of discrimination tackled by the two bodies but also their different capacities of remedying discrimination by relying mainly on mediation: while the Commission in New York has been forced by excessive workload and eventually political pressures to shift its main focus away from litigation, the Office of Barcelona&rsquo;s mediation is hindered by constraints placed upon it by state defined regimes of citizenship, the systemic and complex nature of discrimination and the lack of adequate investigative and remedial powers. Issues of group-related rights of religious minorities emerge in both cities, with the Center of Barcelona operating with the ambiguous perspective of both supporting these rights and controlling religious minorities for security purposes."

This scholarship also recognises that throughout the twentieth century self-determination has played a key role in the demise of empire and the ensuing formation of new states. This was the case with the conclusion of World War I, with the wave of post-World War II decolonisation, and following the break-up of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. However, whereas scholarship depicts self-determination as central to the legitimacy of new states and international society, it does not tell us much about what happens after statehood is recognised. The assumption that self-determination ends where sovereignty starts, the author argues, obscures the ambiguous role that self-determination has played before, and crucially after statehood is recognised. Invoked to universalise the model of the nation-state and sovereign equality, self-determination has concurrently involved exclusions and hierarchies, both domestically and systemically. The present thesis is concerned with this fundamental and yet largely neglected part of the story of the expansion of international society. More precisely, the author argues that twentieth century understandings and usages of the idea of self-determination point to the existence of a recurrent tension. This is a tension between the egalitarian aspirations of self-determination on one hand, and practices of hierarchy associated with self-determination on the other. For each of the 20th century waves of expansion of international society, this tension has been evident at three different levels of world politics. First, it has been embodied in the disciplinary role of international society, when self-determination was redefined, during each wave of state formation, as the standard of legitimate membership and statehood. Second, the tension has manifested itself at the domestic level of the newly &ldquo;self-determined&rdquo; states as boundaries of national political communities were delineated. Third, and as an implication of all this, the tension is found in the ordering of states within international society."

I argue that Poland can be best viewed as a case of implicit familialism, and Hungary as a case of what I call, optional familialism. Polish family policy is largely residual in the sense that social programs in Poland leave the sphere of care almost solely to the family. In Hungary, in contrast, we find a much more &lsquo;progressive&rsquo; family support system with relatively generous benefits and services in support of women and childcare. In my view, the differences in family policy between these two countries are in themselves substantively interesting. We need to know more about family policies in this part of the world. But I am also interested in explaining these differences. I find it puzzling that these two countries share broadly common historical experiences having both undergone massive and similar regime changes over the past 50 years - yet appear to have developed such different policy systems. It would be reasonable to expect that they would have similar social (and in this case: family) policies. What we find, however, is that in spite of the common political and economic transformations - from early democratizing nations, to communist dictatorships, and finally to capitalist democracies - family policies have followed remarkably consistent patterns in each country. Indeed, the family policy regimes found today in each of these countries have more in common with the regimes found in each country 50 years ago than they do with each other. The question is: why? My main argument is that the development of family policies in Hungary and Poland is the example of a path-dependent institutional evolution. Following the authors that have recently emphasised the role of agency, the thesis presents family policy development in these two countries as the case of an agent-based mechanism of institutional evolution. In particular, I describe the role of different kinds of actors in defining the problems and providing solutions within the field of professional and family life. Furthermore, the mechanism focuses on the role of public bureaucrats playing with the formal and informal rules governing the administrative mode of operation."

False identities allow criminals to cross borders, launder money, claim benefits and gain access to other people's information  whilst perceived insecurity in identification systems is widely seen as holding back the development of egovernment and online commerce. All over the world, nation states are investing heavily in the security of their identification systems, trying to protect themselves against such threats, especially through the creation of &ldquo;electronic&rdquo; identification cards and the increased use of biometric technology. Existing literature on these new identification systems has so far focussed on the politics of security, especially security crises like 9/11, and how the legitimating power of this politics enables the creation of these systems. Many authors have argued that this politics serves expand the powers of government surveillance systems, whilst drowning out competing concerns about the impact these systems may have on human rights such as privacy and liberty, and some have even gone as far as to claim that European nations are developing into &ldquo;surveillance states&rdquo;. Ten years on from 9/11 it is clear that this literature is at best incomplete. Far from instituting totalising societies of surveillance and control, many of these systems have run into significant trouble following their creation. Some have suffered from years of delay, going vastly over budget in the process  others, once created, have seen poor usage of supposedly central features. The implementation of new electronic services remains difficult  whilst many question if our borders are really any more secure than they were a decade ago. This thesis seeks to explore what happened, and in so doing provide an insight into how the dynamics of security politics affect the construction of identification systems."

Why are they effective in different ways? According to conventional wisdom, an army&rsquo;s material resources, such as the number of troops it can deploy, its equipment, and budget more generally, determine their level of success and failure in peace operations. Yet, my analysis proves that the link between resources and success of peace and stability operations is, on average, not very strong. I argue, first, that this is because the dichotomy of success and failure of a mission does not always reflect a military organization&rsquo;s 'peace operation effectiveness,' a new concept developed to evaluate peacekeepers&rsquo; practices. Second, I show that despite an increasing convergence among armies worldwide, and between Western ones in particular, soldiers still behave differently in the field. For instance, in two very different operations, the NATO mission in Afghanistan and the UN mission in Lebanon, the French and the Italian battalions deploy a similar number of soldiers and similar equipment and vehicles. In addition, they operate under the same NATO and UN procedures and identical rules of engagement, implementing similar doctrines, receiving similar training and deploying in areas with comparable threat levels. However, they behave very differently. In a second step I argue that it is the difference in the force employment on the tactical level that explains variation in effectiveness. But why do armies behave differently in peace operations? The third part of my argument contends that, in opposition to the prevailing sociological, military, and political factors, the most important source of variation in force employment are differences in the 'military culture' of different military units. In order to understand and test this argument, I conducted extensive fieldwork in Lebanon and Afghanistan between 2007 and 2008. This work lies at the crossroads between security studies and military sociology and makes an empirical contribution to debates about the role of ideational factors in the social sciences."

In this thesis, we make a revision of the extensive literature on the issue. Several perspectives have been developed that we use to frame our research design. We use an institutional approach to analyse immigrant and pro-immigrant political mobilisation in two countries: Portugal and Italy. We use two empirical sets of data to give a general overview of immigrant political mobilisation, on the one hand, and in-depth analysis of political mobilisation with different sorts of actors, on the other hand. We use a political opportunities structures approach for each country, analysing the immigration and immigrant laws in the nineties and beginning of the current decade. We continue with the anaysis of two immigrant groups for each country, comparing political mobilisation forms, frames, identities and repertoires of action promoted by those immigrant groups. This sort of case study approach allows discerning differences and comon aspects among both groups. We finally analyse the civil society structure for each country with the intend to establish the kind of civil society structure and how each state configuration conditions the political mobilisation of proimmigrant actors.

This thesis tests the hypothesis that mainstream parties have reacted to the rise of an anti-immigration party by taking up more restrictive immigration positions. Previous research on the impact of the rise of an anti-immigration party on immigration positioning is sparse, and centres mostly on the supply side of the political market using one-dimensional left-right explanations, which generally do not provide a satisfactory framework to explain party movement. This thesis is based on a spatial two-dimensional model of political competition and combines analyses of the demand and the supply side of the political market. Focusing on the cases of the Netherlands, Flanders and the UK in the time-period 1987-2010 it shows that parties ultimately respond to electoral pressure when choosing their immigration strategy. The thesis has three main findings. Firstly, voters perceive their parties to have too liberal immigration preferences, causing a persistent anti-immigrant gap to exist. In combination with high divisiveness of the immigration issue for mainstream party constituencies the antiimmigrant gap provides opportunities for an anti-immigration party to emerge strongly in multi-party systems. Secondly, the electoral market on immigration is characterised by conflicting incentives, which makes successfully reacting to an anti-immigration party very difficult, especially for traditional mainstream parties. Thirdly, patterns of political competition on the immigration dimension reflect these conflicting incentives. On the one hand, the high divisiveness of the issue at party level urges mainstream parties of left, centre and right equally to depoliticise. Accordingly, parties tend to compete with relatively liberal immigration positions in the absence of a credible threat by an anti-immigration party. On the other hand, a correlation between the left-right and the immigration dimension on the demand side of the political market at party system level creates a pull towards restrictionism, which is stronger for parties on the right. Once an anti-immigration party presents a credible threat parties indeed react by moving their immigration position closer to that of the anti-immigration party following a left-right logic, sometimes dramatically so. The party system strongly impacts the dynamics of indirect impact: in the UK mainstream parties never lose the initiative on immigration to an anti-immigration party."

In order to examining the phenomena of democratisation in operational detail, the thesis delves into the sub-systemic level of democratisation focusing on two partial regimes - electoral regime and civil service system. The analysis follows on the rational choice premise that the domestic actors&rsquo; strategies of compliance depend on the structure of external incentives i.e. rewards and threats, that appeal to their interest. Our account on the impact of EU conditionality upon democratisation assumes that the likelihood of compliance depends on 1) the size of the rewards attached to conditionality; 2) the size of adoption costs; 3) the clarity of prescriptions and 4) credibility of reinforcement. The first part consists of developing a conceptual framework for assessing and explaining the impact of EU enlargement conditionality over democratisation processes. The second part explores the case of Albanian democratisation and the specific challenge it poses to the working of EU conditionality. The third part analyses the association between EU conditionality and reform seeking to identify whether the fortification of the EU conditionality coincides with a pattern-breaking change in each of the partial regimes of our choice. The thesis concludes that the EU was more successful to foster reforms in the area of electoral competition than public administration and civil service system. The EU seemed to push forward reforms by articulating clear prescriptions regarding the electoral competition; and advancing contractual relations with the country in function of electoral performance."

This question about the link between policy-making and institutional development lies at the heart of the study. It is inspired by an empirical puzzle about the dynamics of European integration. Since 1993 the European Union has developed a strategic approach to enlargement the most relevant trademark of which has been the criteria which acceding states have to meet before entering the Union. The conditionality-based preaccession policy provided the European Commission with a set of new competences vis-&agrave;-vis the candidate states that were not directly derived from the internally applicable legal framework, the acquis communautaire. This kind of conditionality established double standards applicable to the candidate, but not the member states. Scrutinising all cases in which such double standards were created brings to the fore the fact that only in two cases did policies remain indeed limited to the candidate states before accession. In a further three cases the steering instruments the Commission developed in the enlargement context were extended beyond the institutional sub-system of the pre-accession policy to the institutional core of the acquis: why and how? The theoretical framework draws from functionalist theory. The necessary condition for policies to be integrated from a distinct institutional sub-system &ndash; such as the pre-accession policy that applied to candidate states only &ndash; is functional pressure. Double standards create functional pressure for integration per se because they undermine the credibility of the political system in that candidates for membership need to comply with higher standards than members themselves. Functional pressure rises if policies are implemented successfully and if political problems persist so that at the moment of accession they become a common matter of concern for all member states. However, this alone does not explain why a single policy &lsquo;spills-in&rsquo; from a sub-system to the institutional core. The sufficient condition and theoretical explanation builds on Theodore Lowi&rsquo;s arenas of power approach. The variance between the single policies is explained by the policy type at stake that determines which steering instruments emerge in the respective arenas of power. The empirical results show that the Commission indeed extends its steering capacity if policies are formulated as non-binding rules and standards in the regulatory arena or in a restrictive way that limits redistributive effects in the distributive arena. In conclusion, the thesis contributes to three strands of European integration research. First, it offers a theoretically-guided analysis of European Union widening. Enlargement policy is conceptualised as an institutionally linked but distinct arena of institutional rules. The effect that policy-making in such an institutional sub-system has may hence be extended and applied to other institutional sub-systems that are linked to but distinct from the Union&rsquo;s core legal framework. Second, the study provides insights into the functioning the European Commission and how the organisation continues effectively to extend its steering capacities in the post-Maastricht era. Moreover, the case studies cover policy fields not much discussed in the existing scholarly literature. They therefore provide original research on how the Commission actually develops new responsibilities and implements policies. Third, the findings inform the study of European integration at large. Spelling out how implementing enlargement has been a source for extending the European Commission&rsquo;s action capacity, the thesis highlights the process of widening as a specific cause for supranational institutionalisation which has so far attained little if any attention."

Skill formation in England and Germany","2009","WENTZEL,  Joachim","Education -- European Union countries; Vocational education -- European Union countries; Continuing education -- European Union countries; Occupational training -- European Union countries","This dissertation deals with education systems and the change observed within them alongside changes in the wider political economy. The research is conducted by way of a comparative case study of England and Germany, two countries which in the Varieties of Capitalism (VoC) literature represent two very different types of economic coordination (thereby making the study conform to a 'most different research design'). Extending the VoC approach, not only vocational education and training but also school education and higher education are analysed, since these two areas contribute decisively to national skill formation. The point of departure is the puzzling fact that the current reforms of the education systems of both countries are departing from the paths predicted by the VoC approach. The thesis thus argues against institutional path-dependency in the two countries, and in favour of an ideational approach based on discursive institutionalism. First, the theoretical chapter (second chapter) of the thesis includes discussions of discursive institutionalism, policy diffusion, and conceptual mechanisms of institutional change, and provides a framework which accounts for path-deviant discourses and reforms. Secondly, a description of the three educational areas in both countries sketches the paths the systems should have pursued if they were to evolve path-dependently. Thereby this chapter serves as a reference point against which recent developments are assessed (fourth chapter). Thirdly, a textual discourse analysis of various White Papers of the British Government formulating policies on skill formation serves to identify visions and aims. The same procedure is applied for relevant policy papers in Germany (fifth chapter). Finally, the translation of visions into concrete policy measures is analysed by focusing on three important reform measures in each country (sixth chapter). On the basis of the policy cycle stages these measures are traced back to their original intentions and are contrasted with the implemented initiatives. This procedure elucidates how reforms match and potentially alter the existing institutional design, how ideas drive educational reforms, and how they resist, 'bend', or even vanish, once they are employed in concrete policy initiatives."

NCW stands for the belief that through the extended application of information technologies and the integration of intelligence, reconnaissance, surveillance, command and control systems and weapons into one single network, military organisations will be able to better collect crucial military information, thus reduce operational uncertainty and gain a decisive information advantage over their enemies, which thus would translate into superiority over the enemy on the battlefield. NCW was invented by U.S. senior military officers and Pentagon officials and was introduced into the U.S. Armed Forces as part of the U.S. military transformation during the tenure of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld (2001-2006). Although NCW had been criticised from the beginning, initial military accomplishments in the Afghanistan war (2001) and the invasion in Iraq (2003) have been widely interpreted as success stories for NCW. Since 2001, a number of U.S. military allies and partners &ndash; among them the United Kingdom and Germany &ndash; have started to adopt this U.S. innovation. Yet, in a number of cases the adopted national versions of NCW diverged considerably from the original U.S. concept. This study seeks to uncover the reasons for the variation in concept adoption. Building upon an organisational institutionalist framework, I argue that, in the United Kingdom, NCW was adopted to increase the military effectiveness and efficiency of the armed forces, whereas the adoption in Germany was mainly driven by the aim to maintain the armed forces&rsquo; institutional legitimacy. Thus, in the case of NCW adoption, the British military was an efficiency maximiser whereas the German military was a legitimacy maximiser."

Having as a main toolkit the partisan influence from their family socialization, they gradually develop firm political attitudes as they accumulate political experience. However, this process is typically regarded as a black box, lacking a systematic examination of how it actually takes place. Thus, our knowledge about the political trajectory of young people does not typically go beyond the assertion that parental influence gradually wanes and that young adults progressively develop firm attitudes as they accumulate more experience with the political world. The goal of this study is to open this black box by focusing on three factors that are perceived to affect this process, namely the role of family, elections and political events. In so doing, it tries to address the following questions: what determines the durability of the parental partisan link? Why manifesting preference into actual vote might be important? What is the role of political events in shaping people&rsquo;s attitudes? Regarding the first question, I show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, parental politicization may contribute in breaking the intergenerational transmission of partisan predispositions. A young Republican who comes from a politicized home is used to talk about politics and this is also what she does when she enters new social contexts. In so doing, she becomes exposed to new political forces that may alter her prior partisan beliefs. This is especially true when the political mood during her early adulthood contradicts the partisan lessons of the family. Regarding the second question, I use a natural experiment to estimate the impact of the act of voting on partisan change, showing that its effect in reinforcing prior preferences is important only among the youth. Moreover, by ruling out various alternative explanations, I argue that this is mainly an effect attributed to the psychological forces of cognitive dissonance that stem from the act of voting. Last but not least, by testing three salient political events, I find that their impact among young adults is much stronger than among older age groups. When taken as a whole, the findings speak in favor of a particular pattern of attitudinal crystallization, namely that proposed by the Impressionable Years thesis: there is a developmental process in how people form well defined preferences but the crucial route in this trajectory is early adulthood. This is the period within which preferences are questioned, intensified and eventually crystallized."

In order to accomplish this task, an original approach to process tracing is adopted using methods used in social movement studies. The internal aspects of campaigns are investigated using a dynamic, cross-time and multi-level, frame analysis, while the contexts of the campaigns are analysed through political and discursive opportunity approaches adapted to the peculiarities of the EU arena. Four case studies, including two campaigns concerned with environmental / public health policy (GMOs and coexistence, and the REACH legislation) and two concerned with broadly defined social policy (the mid-term review of the Lisbon agenda and the Services directive), make up the empirical part of the study. Drawing on documentary evidence as well as semi-structured interviews with staff members from the core SMOs involved in each campaign at the Brussels level, the processes leading to access, agenda, or policy outcomes (or indeed non-outcomes) are traced using the analytical methods mentioned above. These processes provide the basis for preliminary conclusions on the nature of campaigning in the EU. Elite allies are found to be important in securing desired outcomes in campaigns, as are solid, previously agreed shared frames between coalition organisations. The cases also show that the EU is not an arena where conventional tactics (i.e. lobbying) are always enough &ndash; indeed the ability to campaign effectively at multiple levels using appropriate tactics is identified as a major factor in campaigns that saw positive outcomes. This finding challenges the idea that the EU arena is unsuitable to protest actions (e.g. Marks and McAdam 1996). Finally, the study uncovers the beginnings of a divide between &lsquo;technical&rsquo; and &lsquo;political&rsquo; campaigns in the EU. Stemming from the finding that national contexts still provided the opportunities or threats that appeared most important in campaign outcomes, the cases showed that where campaigns were more &lsquo;political&rsquo; - in that they were more ideologically charged - groups were more likely to be able to mobilise grassroots members and secure their desired outcomes. In more &lsquo;technical&rsquo; cases, where the European Commission played a greater role, mobilisation efforts were subdued as groups sunk their resources in long cycles of consultation and knowledge production geared to the needs of the Commission."

While transnational interactions have indeed proliferated, EU support has diminished. This dissertation aims at solving this puzzle by arguing that transnational interaction is highly stratified across society. Its impact on EU support therefore only applies to a small portion of the public. The rest of the population not only fails to be prompted to support the integration process, but may see it as a threat to their realm. This is even more the case as parallel to European integration, global processes of transnationalisation create tensions in national societies. Consequently, the hypotheses guiding this dissertation are as follows: (1) The more transnational an individual, the more (s)he is prone to support European integration. (2) This effect is more pronounced in countries and regions that are more transnationalised. These hypotheses are tested using multilevel analyses of survey data from the Eurobarometer waves 65.1 (2006) and 67.1 (2007). The analyses show that transnational interactions and networks are concentrated among a small group of highly educated, young Europeans. Individuals highly engaged in transnational interactions and well endowed with transnational human capital are significantly more likely to support EU membership and to consider themselves as European, even more so in highly globalised countries. This relationship is weaker, however, in intra- European border regions, where transnational interaction is less stratified across society."

In this respect, the recognition of same-sex couples constitutes a fundamental element of a changing social environment in the contemporary European context and as a phenomenon stands at the centre of the inquiry. The interest in the functions of the law in identity construction explains the topical focus on legal changes. Qualitative research methods are combined with a theoretical inquiry into notions of recognition and identity. Fifty in-depth interviews have been conducted in France, Germany, Italy and the UK. The fieldwork focuses on a metropolitan lesbian and gay bar milieu: respondents were approached in bars and caf&eacute;s in Berlin, London, Paris, and Rome. This fieldwork and the discourses and narratives that stem from it constitute the main empirical source of the project. The notion of identity management (Goffman), a critical theory approach to recognition (Honneth) and a social theory approach to the individual and social change (Kaufmann) feed into the research project from the outset and are in tum informed by it. What does it mean for lesbians and gays to experience the current debates on same-sex marriage and partnership laws? How, if at all, do the normative changes in their social environments affect their life plans, the understanding of their own lives, and the expression of homosexuality in public settings? How can the researcher link the very personal level of individual lives to the macro-level of normative change in society at large and in the legal and political realm?"

It asks how the Irish separatist project was able to go from political marginality up to 1916, to the attainment, with widespread popular support, of an essentially independent state covering most of Ireland just a few years later - a violent and unexpected process. Focusing on the years 1916-1921, the thesis explains what happened as a path dependent reactive sequence - that is, a chain of events initiated by a highly contingent happening, setting in motion a series of reactions and counter-reactions. That highly contingent happening was the Easter Rising of 1916 - a surprise attack on British rule in Dublin - and it was the product of the agency of a small band of rebels. The sequence it set in motion brought deep structural tensions to the boil - but this might never have happened were it not for the agency of the rebels. The thesis examines this classic paradox of the structure-agency relationship via a focus on the strategic interaction of the Irish rebels and the British state, and attempts to identify the key causal mechanisms involved. These mechanisms were shaped by key British policy choices as much as by rebel action - from the British government's initial decision to back-pedal on meaningful Irish autonomy, to the subsequent policy drift towards brutal and indiscriminate repression in Ireland. The thesis suggests that were it not for the crucial transformative event that started this fateful sequence in 1916, Ireland might well have stayed within the United Kingdom."

It is argued that the on-going conflict adversely affects the relationship between the two ethnic groups, but that the tensions and conflict dynamics are not an exact reflection of the situation in the homeland, and instead take a different form in each hostland. The contentions between the groups and their grievances are dependent on several factors that are rooted in the hostland and directly or indirectly affect how these groups establish contact with one another. These include: the profile of the migrants; the size of the ethnic communities; the ratio of one ethnic community to another in the hostland; the political and discursive opportunity structures in the hostland; and the relations between the homeland and the hostland. The second generation were selected as the sample group in this thesis as they offer a clearer picture of the host country impact, as well as the persistence of conflict dynamics in the diaspora spaces. The arguments that this thesis makes are based largely on field research, which included interviews with academics, politicians, migrant organisation leaders, as well as first- and second-generation diaspora members. Sweden and Germany were selected on the grounds that both have significant populations of non-European migrants and in particular because they have Turkish and Kurdish populations that show different diasporic tendencies, thus making them relevant cases for comparison. The comparison of their approaches to migrant incorporation; multiculturalism as a formal state policy; the corporatist structures that they have developed with migrant organisations; the profile of the migrants they have received; and, their approach to the Kurdish question in Turkey, sheds light on the varying dynamics of conflict-import to a host country by diaspora groups."

This study investigates the institutional conditions explaining the cross-national variation of activation policies' outcomes in the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy between the mid-1990's and 2009. Revoking existing benefits for diffused and uncertain advantages, these policies faced harsh opposition from the coalitions (labour and capital organizations) interested in keeping the costs of early exit externalized for their members (older workers and their employers). In this study the central research question is: to what extent has the effectiveness of activation policies been affected by the organizational articulation of the externalization coalitions? The articulation of these coalitions is framed according to the affinities coupling protection, production and partnership institutions. From an actor-centered perspective, the EWL re-conversion is depicted as a sequential game. Under irresistible environmental pressure, the state first interact with social partners to retrench welfare incentives and then to encourage HRM strategies to retain older workers. The higher is the organizational articulation of labour and capital, the more interactions tend to be framed in social governance modes that, discouraging opportunistic actions, convey the EWL reconversion from the strategy of the state into the companies' HRM. In these cooperative modes social partners are thus expected to not hinder but to support the adoption of retrenchment and retaining policies. Being the articulation the highest in the Netherlands, lower in Germany and the lowest in Italy, the effectiveness of activation policies is expected to follow the same pattern. This hypothesis is tested using Event History Analysis on data drawn from the third wave of the SHARE in a two-stage research design estimating the effectiveness of retrenchment and retaining policies. The main findings show that social partners mediated the EWL re-conversion, promoting the effectiveness of activation in the Netherlands and hindering it among their members more in Italy than in Germany."

Because they can pool and redistribute individual risks, these policies are likely to embody or facilitate a change of paradigm or economic system. However, the orientation of policies is also a matter of negotiation between the government and various interest groups. This is well illustrated in Poland, where post- 1989 transformations involved a redefinition of the relationship between the state and the community of citizens and provide an opportunity to observe the dynamics of large-scale change over a relatively condensed period. The thesis investigates three issues in this context: the nature of the emerging welfare system; the factors accounting for policy change, and the existence of a new socio-political compromise underlying the emerging work and welfare nexus. The analysis builds on a conceptual framework drawing on two streams of literature: the comparative studies of the welfare state in Western Europe and theories of public policy making. The first leads to a set of hypothesis that seek to explain change in the perspective of &lsquo;regime politics&rsquo; while the second suggests on the contrary that conflicts and compromises are arising in different arenas defined by a configurations of actors and power relationships that are specific to each policy domain (employment regulation, labour market policies and pensions). The thesis uses original and secondary empirical material to assesses, on one hand, the validity of theories of the welfare state based on power resources, class cleavages and institutional pathdependence to explain the orientation of social policies in the post-communist context, and on the other, the idea that the representation of interests and the actors involved in the decisionmaking process are being shaped by the nature of the policy at stake.

This work seeks to enhance the literature in three different ways. First of all, party and party system institutionalization are clearly considered as two different, although related, phenomena. Second, and building on Mair (1996, 2001), it attempts to advance party system analyses by improving the operationalization of institutionalization. In this context, a new operationalization which is both conceptually and empirically superior to the existing ones is suggested. Finally, and contrary to the tendency of explaining party system formation and development using either an institutional or a sociological approach, a serious effort is made to bring the two approaches together when examining the process of party system institutionalization in new democracies. The analysis here undertaken indicates that party system institutionalization in new East Central European democracies has been enhanced by both supportive institutional structures (i.e. political parties, electoral systems, type of regime) and strong &ldquo;cleavage&rdquo; structuration. The idea is that as individual political parties institutionalized (i.e. develop stable roots in society and solid organizations), they help voters to make the political expression of social cleavages more consistent, thereby avoiding instability in the patterns of inter-party competition for government. Second, party system format, itself a function of the type of electoral system adopted, also plays a role. The logic is that the lower the number of parties, the lower the transaction costs and the potential conflicts in terms of partisan interaction are likely to be. Third, in clear contrast to parliamentarian regimes, semi-presidentialism has a negative effect (both direct and indirect) on the process of party system institutionalization. Finally, the type of cleavage development is considered to have a positive (cumulative) or negative (cross-cutting) effect on the process of systemic institutionalization."

In his book, Making Islam Democratic, Bayat argues that the relevant question is not whether Islam is compatible with democracy, but rather under what conditions Muslims can make the two compatible (Bayat 2007). This new approach has opened the way for research on the conditions under which religious actors offer support for democracy. While my research starts from this same point, I have come to the conclusion that religious authorities' attitude is neither a fixed position nor an ideological one  rather the attitude of the same religious group might change from one phase to another. Hence, the research question this dissertation seeks to answer is not only why certain Islamic actors have offered support for democracy while others have not, but also why the same religious actors have shifted their position on democracy over time. The answer lies, I argue, in the institutional rules governing religion-polity relations. While the four religious actors studied here share the same material and ideational interests, they have adopted different strategies, which in turn vary with different institutional settings, in order to achieve these interests. Religious actors' attitudes towards democracy reflect a rational choice that is made after assessing to what extent democracy advances or hinders their other strategies and interests."

A multitude of policy fields are affected, including environment, trade and security. Responding to the challenges triggered by Europeanization and globalization, governments increasingly interact across different spheres of authority. Both theoretically and empirically, the puzzle of institutional choice reflected by the variety of arrangements in which intergovernmental cooperation takes place inside individual countries and across their borders remains surprisingly under-explored. In an attempt to solve this puzzle, the dissertation tackles the following questions: Why are the intergovernmental arrangements governments set up to deal with boundary-crossing problems so different? To what extent do these institutional differences affect the effectiveness of intergovernmental cooperation? To address this gap theoretically and empirically, this book adopts a deductive, rationalist approach to institution-building. It argues that internal politics, the type of executive-legislative relations within the interacting governments, explains the nature of institutions set up to channel intergovernmental processes: while power-sharing governments engage in institution-building, power-concentrating governments avoid it. It also shows that these institutional choices matter for the output of intergovernmental cooperation. The approach is applied to Canada, Switzerland, the United States, and finally the European Union. Disaggregating individual government units, the theoretical approach reveals how intragovernmental micro-incentives drive macro-dynamics and thereby addresses the neglect of horizontal dynamics in multilevel systems. The willingness and capacity of lower-level governments to solve collective problems on their own and to oppose central encroachment are crucial to understand the power distribution in different systems and their long-term evolutions."

Through two contrasting case studies of the UNDP-led micro-disarmament programme in Kosovo and the EU Small Arms programme in Cambodia, the research considers ways in which local agency deal with &lsquo;norm transfer&rsquo; by international organizations. First, the thesis theoretically advances constructivist literature on norm diffusion so to apply to international peacebuilding in general, and Small Arms Control specifically. Treating peacebuilding as exercises in norm diffusion enables more subtle analyses of the political processes involved, taking seriously the politics of norms when international actors get involved in post-war societies. Bringing in dynamic processes of norm localization to the study of micro-disarmament enables better conceptions of agents, processes and mechanisms involved in the reconfiguration of power in peacebuilding contexts. Second, based on extensive fieldwork the thesis provides comparative analyses of how local elites constructed national identity narratives in post-war Kosovo and Cambodia parallel to micro-disarmament processes. In the case of Cambodia, national elites successfully built a narrative of the Khmer nation as idle, peaceful and respectful of authority  an identity consistent with an idea of the state as the legitimate authority over the use of force. Due to enabling social and political factors, the EU Small Arms project supported these discourses of a collective, post-war security culture, and could subsequently contribute to eradicate the small arms problem in Cambodia. In Kosovo, conversely, political elites imbued the post-war nationbuilding process with identity narratives consistent with an individualist security culture. These narratives pitted an autonomous, militant and traditional society against the state monopoly on legitimate use of force. The UNDP Small Arms project did not locate its activities in these discourses, and failed to significantly reduce the availability of small arms in society. The empirical findings of this thesis point to a real need for international organizations to allow local conceptions of legitimacy to take centre stage when introducing democratic security models in post-war countries. Consistent with constructivist scholarship, it finds that norms, culture and identity are not secondary considerations, but effectively produce actors&rsquo; preferences and interests. International norm proponents must engage local rationalities when seeking to transfer norms &ndash; even in matters of &lsquo;hard&rsquo; security."

This is done through an in-depth comparative study of the inter-party contacts between the communist and later post-communist parties of Poland and Hungary, on one hand, and the German SPD and the British Labour Party on the other. The thesis analyzes the scope of these contacts, the activity of bilateral groups, and the support offered to the Polish and Hungarian post-communist parties before and after 1989. The literature on democratization in post-communist Europe and that on post-communist parties in particular has neglected this issue, and the importance of inter-party contacts therefore tends to be overlooked. This study shows that the period prior to the system collapse in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) was not a tabula rasa in terms of contacts between the parties from East and West. Relying on extensive interviews and unprecedented primary research in archival documents, it broadens the discussion, unearthing new material concerning the pre-1989 inter-party contacts and the reasons behind these contacts, as well as offering an original analysis of party goals and strategies of cooperation in the Cold War environment. It brings in international factors to offer a fuller explanation of the post-communist parties&rsquo; successful accommodation to the new reality, emphasising the importance of their antecedent socialization in the social democratic environment long before the collapse of the communist system. It points to the different trajectories of inter-party cooperation and the diverse policies pursued by parties in CEE and in Western Europe and explains these in terms of geographic proximity and their respective foreign and domestic policies. It further traces how personal links between individuals were maintained despite the communist regime collapse and party competition in post-1989 Hungary and Poland. More generally, this thesis emphasises the importance of taking these particular aspects of party activity and development into account within the context of the democratization research."

First, it aims to empirically explore changing interactions between Islamist mobilization in politic and in society,and examine the position state in stitutions have within these changes. Second, it aims to apply insights of studies on social movements and contentious mobilization in the analysis of these interactions. The thesis'main contentions are, first,that in their practice Islamist movements face a dilemma in how to react to a context that is ever more strictly divided between a social and political arena:either mobilization is aimed at societal change through organizing as social associations, or it is aimed at maximizing political influence through organizing as political parties. Irrespective of what their ideology is, all movements face the dilemma of how to reconcile a vision of a complete Islamic system with day-to-day realities. Second, I argue that common strategies addressing the perceived ""secularity"" of state bureaucracies and public institutions can be the basis of a shared goal for mobilization and thereby ensure the unity of the Islamist project. Two specific debates on contentious mobilization-relating to dilemmas of strategic action and the social process of ""upward scale shift""-are then used in conjuncture with one another to provide insights into how these state institutions can influence the relation between Islamist mobilization in society and politics. I substantiate these claims through a paired comparison between Syria and Tunisia. The comparison builds on, first, extensive fieldwork over the course of four years in the Arab world (mainly Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and Jordan) in whic haround 180 individuals have been interviewed. Second, it draws on a content analysis of primary sources from Islamist associations, state institutions, and individual autobiographies of (Islamist)actors; third, it uses secondary sources from local, Arab and international newspapers as the empirical basis for the analysis."

My study contributes to the welfare state reform literature by proposing and testing a novel argument based on a multi-dimensional framework of social policy-making. In a nutshell, the results of the nested-analysis of social policy-making show that in institutional settings where political constraints are high, left-wing party government have an adverse effect on the very poor and unskilled in society and do not meet the general expectations that left-wing policy-making increases the outcome equality. My thesis thus extends the standard welfare state research that generally focuses on a single dimension, e.g. the size of expenditure. Unlike previous research that mainly focuses on the size of spending, this project also takes into account compensatory and redistributive aspects of policies as relevant dimensions. A major shortcoming of the many studies on welfare state reforms is their one-dimensional approach. The empirical analysis is based on a nested analysis design, which combines a quantitative macro-analysis with three case studies. The macro-analysis shows that leftist governments increase compensation, particularly in political systems with high institutional constraints, whereas the size of expenditure is not affected by government partisanship. The case country case studies on a series of unemployment insurance and labor market reforms in Germany, Ireland, and Switzerland trace the underlying policy-making processes that led to these macro-level outcomes. The overall results suggest that party politics in social policy-making still matters, especially in countries with high institutional constraints. However, the mechanisms work differently than generally assumed. The strong linkages between left-wing parties and labor unions may have a partially adverse effect on outcome equality. A high level of political constraints combined with a leftist party government leads to redistributive effects that are predominantly beneficiary for `insiders' which are represented by labor unions. The preferential outcome for the `insiders' comes at the expenses of `outsiders' (mainly unskilled, long-term unemployed and part-time employees), which are not represented by powerful interest organizations (Rueda 2007, 2005). My project thus integrates the apolitical institutionalist theory of welfare state development (`New Politics' approach by Pierson) with theories that assign more importance to political struggles, such as the `power resource' approach by Korpi (1989), Korpi and Palme (1998, 2003)."

More specifically, it deals with the way country level factors shape the disadvantages these early school leavers experience on the European labour market, when compared with those who have at least upper secondary education. To the extent that country level variation in the labour market integration of early school leavers can be attributed to specific institutional and macro-structural characteristics, it enriches the single cross-national definition of early school leaving, and points towards best practices that can be learned from. The overarching research question that runs through this thesis is twofold. To what extent is the labour market integration of early school leavers in Europe obstructed by the country-specific macro-structural factors underlying a knowledge economy? And, second, can the various education and labour market policies across the European countries help to decrease the relative labour market disadvantage of early school leavers? The concept of early school leaving, the process of ranking and rating countries on the basis of institutional and macro-structural characteristics, and the increasing availability of standardised country level indicators have all developed through a cross-fertilisation of academic research and EU policy making, which is why this thesis draws upon both the empirical literature and the Lisbon objectives when arguing the relevance of the research and formulating its conclusions. Using the ESS, the ECHP, and the EU-SILC, this thesis addresses the cross-level influences of educational expansion, skill-biased occupational change, the type and quality of the education and training system, and labour market policies. In conclusion, attention is drawn to the three most relevant findings in this research. These are (1) the downside of an equitable educational system, (2) the benefit of a higher educational quality, and (3) the influence of durable active labour market policy."

Ideas, justification and rhetorical choice in 30 years of German employment policy making","2011","ZUTAVERN, Jan",NA,"Confidence in capitalist societies about the state&rsquo;s capacity to exert rational control over markets and commit them to wider social values is waning. In Western Europe employment trends since the 1970s above all have casted doubt on the feasibility of active statehood. At the same time, governments have proven conspicuously unable to renounce their commitment to the promise, so central to modern industrial society, of an economy that serves man, and provides decent, socially valuable work for all who seek it. This has been true in particular for the German welfare state and its deeply rooted reliance on the imagery of full &lsquo;normal&rsquo; or &lsquo;quality&rsquo; employment as a critical touchstone for policy makers. It is the seeming paradox that German governments have sought justification for employment policy after the mid-1970s primarily through liberalization that this thesis addresses. The argument draws on a theoretical framework that champions &lsquo;ideas&rsquo; as the dual foundation of policy making &ndash; in the form of institutionally supported knowledge that defines the practice of making policy in a democratic context, and as the semantic structures internal to policy related arguments that determine which aspects of a given policy reality can come to inform rational policy projects. Based on an analysis of the semantic structures underlying employment debates in Germany, and the arguments with which policy makers have designed and justified legislative initiatives, the thesis draws attention to the relation between the normative tensions faced by policy makers and the nature of diagnostic arguments through which employment problems are interpreted through time as a key to understanding rhetorical choices. The diagnostic framework that informed the liberalization of German employment policy then becomes intelligible as the politically most viable and pragmatic solution to the rhetorical problem of reconciling multiple and conflicting demands on state authority."

International responsibility and grave humanitarian crises","2008","PELTONEN, Hannes","Responsibility to protect (International law)","The traditional debate concerning humanitarian intervention has changed since the publication of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) report. This thesis addresses both the debate before the publication of the R2P report and the report itself by examining in-depth the international responsibility, which the international community shares in relation to such grave humanitarian crises as genocide. It is argued that the debate before the R2P report made implicit assumptions about international responsibility. Moreover, international collective responsibility is examined both at a conceptual level and at a practical level, thus contributing to the discussion after the publication of the R2P report. It is argued that especially the conceptualization of international responsibility is lacking in the report, and this thesis suggests a conceptualization of international collective responsibility, which is then modeled in the second half of this thesis. Furthermore, the responsibility model and its functioning are illustrated first with the help of a thought experiment and then by examining the Rwandan genocide in 1994 and some of the international responses to the tragedy. The responsibility model serves also as a tool for evaluating the international responses, and thus the justifications of non-intervention are assessed. On a higher level this thesis contributes to an understanding of the functioning of international politics. For example, the thesis argues for a particular understanding of the international community as well as state practice within the community. Moreover, the thesis addresses some of the roles that states have and some of the expectations that we have of states at the international level. Finally, the use of discretion in practicing international politics is an underlying theme of this thesis, thus addressing both what is the politics in international politics and how it is or should be conducted."

This thesis approaches that puzzle and attempts to provide a better understanding of the role of law in society through the concept of juridification. I conceive the problem of juridification of Western societies in qualitative rather than quantitative/managerial terms. This conceptual strategy allows me to challenge the literature on de-regulation and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms concluding that, contrary to common wisdom, these counter-movements to juridification actually reinforce it. I argue that the coupling between judicial review and the constitutionalisation of rights produced a qualitative change in the role of law that enabled the legal system to supersede the political one. This leads to a lock-in situation where the legal system has the capacity of deciding its own reach, thereby becoming, with qualifications, autopoietic. This historical narrative also shows that, contrary to autopoietic theory, juridification is not a purely legally endogenous process. The expanded role of law in society is not without problems. I show how European case law extended state liability in domestic legal orders replacing the once predominant public-interest justifications by the one size fits all&rdquo; rights talk. For the same reason, while often heralded as a sign of progress, I demonstrate how a rights-based social order is plagued by practical problems. In particular, I focus on the way in which three projects advanced to solve conflicts of rights / balancing, specification and trumps / hide its fundamental agonistic nature.

Nelle due grandi citt&agrave; mediterranee le organizzazioni criminali sembrano avere stabilmente assunto un ruolo che va al di l&agrave; della gestione di singole attivit&agrave; illegali, sia pur importanti e ramificate. Gli interi contesti urbani di Napoli e Marsiglia ne sono stati caratterizzati, al punto da rimanere marchiati da una persistente &laquo;mauvaise r&eacute;putation&raquo; ed essere considerati in se stessi &laquo;criminogeni&raquo;. In realt&agrave;, in entrambi i casi, i sistemi criminali, esaminati da vicino e nel corso della loro lunga parabola otto-novecentesca, si presentano assai mobili, occupano ruoli cangianti, mostrano un'attitudine all'adattamento che conosce come unica costante proprio la loro capacit&agrave; di autoriproduzione. Le &laquo;&eacute;lites criminali&raquo; di Napoli e Marsiglia passano da una fase che si pu&ograve; definire &laquo;archeologica&raquo; e che corrisponde agli esordi ottocenteschi, attraverso i grandi cambiamenti di fine Ottocento e poi del nostro secolo, fino a un ampliamento dei mercati illeciti e dei sistemi clientelari che raggiunge l'apice nei tempi a noi pi&ugrave; vicini. Il punto decisivo &egrave; rappresentato dai legami che queste &eacute;lites illegali riescono di volta in volta a intrecciare con la societ&agrave;, con il contesto &laquo;legale&raquo; nel quale, spesso agevolmente, si muovono. L'approccio comparato consente di mettere in rilievo analogie e differenze, fasi e tempi, modi e articolazioni delle iniziative criminali, punti di forza e di debolezza, reti clandestine e modi di &laquo;emersione&raquo;. La conclusione &egrave; sorprendente: le organizzazioni criminali non hanno in s&eacute; la capacit&agrave; di crescere e di misurare la propria potenza; sono le istituzioni legali, quelle dell'ordine pubblico e quelle preposte alla formazione della pubblica opinione, a conferire con la loro stessa azione una capacit&agrave; di &laquo;accredito &raquo; ai gruppi criminali che operano nelle due citt&agrave;."

The main objective of the study, which encompasses four countries - the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia - is to identify policy incentives and historical legacies that influenced the current minority policies. In addition, it also aspires to adjust existing typological theories which aim to explain the development of minority policies in the four countries after 1989. By comparing minority policies in the light of three hypotheses on their main factors, namely the historical, international and domestic, it is argued that in spite of different initial policy directions, the minority policies in the four countries gradually converged. The early post-1989 minority polices were shaped primarily by historical legacies and domestically conceptualised strategies, which reflected the importance of both domestic minority issues and kin nationals in neighbouring states. Together with the appearance of stronger international incentives (particularly the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (FCNM) and the European Union assessment during the accession processes), the countries gradually modified their positions, framing their policies around the norms provided by the FCNM. In the conclusion, the thesis argues that existing theories on the development of minority policies in CEE could partially explain the preference for particular policy directions in the four countries. However, in order to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the contemporary shape of the minority policies, any further explanatory attempts should also carefully address the legacies of previous policy choices and the role of international norms on minority protection."

However, the parliamentary legislative organisation is under-researched despite its profound consequences for EU policies and policy-making. Addressing this gap, this thesis studies the internal setup and legislative impact of the EP committees. Drawing on congressional literature, I confront distributive, informational and partisan theoretical approaches to answer the research questions of this project, namely whether and why the EP committees and their legislative output are dominated by preference-outlying legislators with special interests, experts serving the informational needs of the plenary, or loyal members of the working majority party group (coalition). Statistical analyses of committee assignments, allocation of legislative tasks, and adoption of committee reports in plenary are conducted using data on the 6th European Parliament (2004-2009). They are complemented with evidence from semi-structured interviews. The results show that legislators&rsquo; special interests and expertise account for the formally regulated assignment to committees depending on the predominant character of their legislative output (distributive or regulatory). In contrast, party group affiliation and loyalty shape the allocation of important legislative tasks in committees, owing to the informal allocation process. Furthermore, committee reports are more successful on the floor if drafted by rapporteurs from the working majority party group - perhaps a natural consequence of the EP open amendment rule. Thus, the parliamentary legislative output is ultimately controlled by the working majority party group and not committees. The congressional rationales fail to account for committees&rsquo; legislative influence when an informal early agreement is reached with the Council of Ministers. This occurs increasingly often, rendering decision-making in committees largely obsolete. The observed regularities are used to advance the literature on legislative organisation by identifying conditions under which each of the main congressional rationales can explain committee setup and influence, namely: 1) the policy areas a committee covers; 2) the parliamentary rules regulating committee-party and committee-plenary relationships; and 3) the balance of power and mode of negotiation between the legislative chambers. More substantively, the EP committees are not conducive for pursuing particularistic policies. Instead, they promote left-right party politics. This has important implications for EU legislative politics, interest representation, legitimacy, and more generally the EU democratic deficit."

I studied the small-scale European preparatory meetings in which hundreds of activists have met six times a year since 2002 to organise the European Social Forums, and form campaigns on global justice, peace, social policies, anti-privatisation, climate change, migration, health, education and other issues. Comparing activists&rsquo; deliberative practices in these European meetings with social forum meetings at the national level in Germany, Italy and the UK, I arrived at a surprising result: European meetings reflect a higher degree of inclusivity and transparency within deliberation and decision-making compared to the national level. The puzzle to understand is this: European meetings bring together the same groups and individuals as national meetings, but they work by a novel practice of translation in multilingual deliberations implemented by activists who do a work of cultural and political translation: principled brokers. Principled brokers intervene on the listening side of deliberative processes and may change those culturally specific 'hearing habits' and informal norms of discussion that work against traditionally marginalised groups. My findings show that the inclusion of currently absent groups in debates on the EU depends less on a lack of voice than on efficient translation. Members of marginalised groups felt to be included in settings where elites actively listened. Careful listening, as a condition for public dialogue, occurred in European meetings that worked with practices of translation and allowed for alliances to form between geographically and socially distant groups. In the national meetings though, a lack of care for listening and translation reproduced exclusionary decision-making among informal elites. This comparison of participatory democracy arenas at the national and European level shows that linguistic and cultural homogeneity may impede rather than facilitate an effectively inclusive public dialogue."

Alexander","Catholic Church -- Diplomatic service; Church and international organization -- Catholic Church; Catholic Church -- Foreign relations -- History -- 20th century; Church and social problems -- Catholic Church; Christian sociology -- Catholic Church","In this thesis I explore the question of how the Holy See translates its own normative vision into concrete diplomatic practice. Drawing upon Alasdair MacIntyre&rsquo;s concept of a &lsquo;living tradition&rsquo;, I argue that Catholic Social Doctrine (CSD) is an exemplary case of a &lsquo;historically extended, socially embodied argument&rsquo; about the good life that provides the Holy See with a source of inspiration and advice, shapes its perception of global politics, constitutes its identity and preferences, and constrains its diplomatic practice. However, due to its &lsquo;living&rsquo; nature, CSD does not provide blueprints for action and falls short of determining papal diplomacy in global politics. A living religious tradition needs to be inherited, interpreted, and incarnated. This process is complicated and leads to political and ethical policy dilemmas as well as to changing patterns of conflict and cooperation with other international actors. I will examine this problematique in the context of four major case studies of papal diplomacy in the post-Second Vatican Council era: the Vietnam War, the Polish crisis in the early 1980s, the United Nations (UN) conferences on population control and women in Cairo and Beijing in the mid-1990s, and the Jubilee 2000 anti-debt campaign. My research findings have four broader implications. First, they will lay out a more fine-tuned approach to the study of religious traditions in IR. Second, they suggest a need for the field of religion and politics to avoid reducing the impact of religious ideas and practices to their causal impact on outcomes. Third, they undermine the analytical accurateness of widespread invocations of &lsquo;holy alliance&rsquo; arguments for characterising Holy See diplomacy. Fourth, they provide good reasons for a more holistic perspective on CSD in particular and religion and politics in general."

Although markets for shares in these countries are now governed in similar way and in line with transnational principles, their openness to external governance model varied, and they adopted it at different speed and accuracy. While in Poland the transfer of rules was voluntary and preceded the opening of market, the Czechs resisted the standard solutions. This thesis shows that theoretical approaches which focus on the mechanisms of transnational norm taking cannot fully explain why two countries which shared many similarities and were under the influence of the same external actors acted so differently when it came to organizing capital market governance. Membership incentives offered by the European Union were not necessary to elicit convergence in one case and they were not sufficient in another. At the same time transnational capital market community, which diffused capital market governance standards, had a profound effect on one country eliciting deep and sustainable convergence, and negligible impact on another. By distinguishing between different degrees of convergence and focusing on the interplay of domestic and external factors, this thesis finds that variation in the pathways to the adoption of a standard capital market governance regime is a function of domestic vulnerability and external intervention. Vulnerability refers to the constellation of factors, both political and economic, that endanger an elite&rsquo;s hold on power. External intervention refers to coercive and non-coercive tools of influence used by different types of external actors: the transnational community and transnational hierarchy. This thesis demonstrates that a substantial and sustainable convergence with transnational standards in capital market governance could be attained by both the transnational hierarchy and transnational community, provided that the level of domestic vulnerability is extremely high. When the level of domestic vulnerability is low both types of transnational actors can attain only limited convergence / a situation in which transnational norms are adopted in selective manner, or are fully adopted but not observed."

In so doing, Arvidsson argues that the culture of consumption we see in Italy today has its direct roots in the social vision articulated by the advertising industry in the years following the First World War. He then goes on to discuss how that vision was further elaborated by advertising's interaction with subsequent big discourses in Twentieth Century Italy: fascism, post-war mass political parties and the counter-culture of the 1960s and 1970s. Based on a wide range of primary sources, this fascinating book takes an innovative historical approach to the study of consumption."

Alternative accountability instruments are, therefore, often introduced in the design of these organizations. This thesis focuses on these instruments, and addresses three related questions: (1) What instruments of accountability are applied to independent agencies? (2) What variation in degrees of accountability can we observe? (3) Why are some independent agencies subject to more accountability instruments than others? Accountability arrangements are set up both by politicians and by independent agencies themselves. An analytical and empirical distinction is, therefore, made between mandatory accountability &ndash; imposed on organizations by politicians &ndash; and voluntary accountability &ndash; introduced by the organizations themselves. Furthermore, as the hypotheses on variation in accountability suggest differences across policy areas and political systems, the empirical study is divided into two parts. The first part compares a wide range of independent agencies in different policy areas within one country &ndash; the Netherlands; while the second part compares independent agencies operating in a single policy area, competition policy, across a wide range of different political systems. The study finds that independent agencies are subject to a variety of accountability instruments, and to varying degrees of accountability. Mandatory and voluntary accountability go hand in hand: organizations with high scores on the one also tend to have high scores on the other. Issue salience is a strong predictor of both types: agencies dealing with more salient issues are subject to more extensive accountability arrangements. Depoliticization plays a role in mandatory accountability, and when more veto players are involved in the policy-making process they tend to introduce fewer provisions for accountability. Other factors which matter for mandatory accountability are the salience of the issue of accountability itself, the level of trust in the civil service, the number of stakeholders of the agency, and the agency&rsquo;s legal status and powers. Factors which matter for voluntary accountability are the democratic experience of, and stakeholders in, the polity, as well as the age, legal status, resources, and competences of the organization."

The focus is set in the 2009 European Parliament election campaign period, and one of the central goals is to observe whether the media agenda-setting capacity varies from country to country or not, and why. The hypothetical causes of cross-country variability are the nature of the several European media systems (in terms of development of press markets, freedom of press, journalist professionalization, state intervention, media partisanship) and their effects in the informational environment, both from the perspective of the supply (information quality) and demand (trust in the media). The results show that these macro-level dimensions vary considerably in Europe, and that there is a link between media system dimensions related to politics, information quality and agenda-setting."

EU enlargement negotiations (1998-2003): Constructive and destructive interference","2007","VAN AKEN, Wim","European Union countries -- Economic policy; European Union -- Membership","Why is it that when economic sectors have strong preferences and mobilise politically on a national and international level one does not always find the respective policy outcomes as &lsquo;demand side&rsquo; international political economic theory predicts? In concentrating on the role national and international institutions play in an open polity model I argue that states (governments) and international organisations (negotiations) and the strategies of actors occupying these institutions mediate societal interests according to what I call the logic of destructive and constructive interference. States and international organisations act as constraints upon societal preferences at the negotiating table when their interests are not aligned. This is &lsquo;destructive interference&rsquo;. Conversely, when societal interests and institutional preferences are aligned states and strategies sustain or amplify societal preferences at the negotiating table. This I refer to as &lsquo;constructive interference&rsquo;. I apply this conjecture to the fifth EU enlargement process (1998-2004) and the negotiated exemptions to the EU accession treaties. First, I quantitatively compare the universe of cases, i.e. 44 economic sectors across the ten applicant states according to their trade, factor and asset specificity. Subsequently, I subject the theory to a qualitative analysis in three economic sectors, i.e. pharmaceuticals, basic iron and steel and the international road freight transport, across four applicant states, i.e. the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. The case studies have been based on sector and country-specific literature and 82 positional and structured interviews. The theoretical framework on the demand side has been provided by insights from modern political economy. The study finds that enlargement had a redistributive influence on sectoral incomes that resulted in preference formation and political mobilisation along sectoral lines. On the supply side, veto players and negotiation theory, combined with assumptions about political preference formation, provided hypothetical guidance. It finds that governments observed sectoral interests when their demand for protection reduced government expenditure and did not damage popular support for EU entry. On an international level, government negotiators found it easier to extract concessions from the EU when constrained by at least one domestic veto player. The EU would extend these concessions to other countries under the banner of equality and reciprocity."

Among these factors, collective memories are particularly relevant: they can help collective action by providing symbolic material from the past, but at the same time they can constrain people's ability to mobilise by imposing proscriptions and prescriptions. In my research I analyse the relationship between social movements and collective memories: how do social movement participate in the building of public memory? And how does public memory, and in particular the media representation of a contentious past, influence the social construction of identity in the contemporary movements? To answer these questions I focus on the student movements in Italy and Spain, analysing the content and format of media sources in order to draw a map of the different narrative representations of a contentious past, while I use qualitative interviews to investigate their influence on contemporary mobilisations. In particular, I focus on the evolution of the representation of specific events in the Italian and Spanish student movements of the 1960s and 1970s in the different public fields, identifying the role of terrorism and political transitions in shaping in the present the publicly discussed image of the past. The thesis draws on a qualitative content analysis of media material, tracing the phases of the commemoration, putting it in historical context, and attempting to reconstruct the different mechanisms of contentious remembrance.

The argument that I present has two levels. The first level consists of two theoretical claims about exploring the moral subjectivity of the state in International Relations. The first claim is that in order to argue meaningfully about the moral subjectivity of the state one has to take seriously the state's being-in-theworld qua state. By relying on Immanuel Kant's political philosophy and practical metaphysics, I will offer a theory that is applicable when one wishes to conceptualise the state as an autonomous entity in its own right, and, subsequently, allows one to argue that all states, despite their different prudential and contingent differences and characteristics, are moral agents. The second theoretical claim is that the moral personhood of the state is not in and of itself merely metaphysical &ndash; that it is, in fact, something purely intrinsic to the agent. Here I depart from Kant's original idea of essentialist moral personality of the state, and, in contrast to Kant, argue that the moral subjectivity of the state is always reciprocal. Moral subjectivity, therefore, cannot be studied without the concept of moral standing: the agent's positioning among other similar entities. Moral subjectivity proper is then constituted by recognition of other similar subjects who consider themselves as moral subjects. Moral subjectivity is always conditional and placed under scrutiny by politics of recognition. The second level of the argument maintains that when one then studies practices of moral subjectivity of the state &ndash; that is, states vis-&agrave;-vis each other in international society &ndash; it is the recognition of subjectivity that plays a central role in identifying states as moral agents in world affairs. While every state in theory qualifies as a moral person, their moral standing as fully-fledged moral subjects is constantly challenged due to their empirical differences in practice. One such difference explored in this study is the liberal/non-liberal character of the state. In order to make sense of the claims of different and sometimes even contradictory moral statuses of different types of empirical states in world politics, I argue that one has to explore the practices of moral subjectivity as well."

Why did the personalist presidencies of Husni Mubarak in Egypt and Zine al-Abidin Ben Ali in Tunisia collapse only weeks into the uprisings while Syria&rsquo;s Bashar al-Assad still holds onto power and Yemen&rsquo;s Ali Abdallah Salih could negotiate his way out of office? Focusing on the cases of Egypt, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen, this thesis is an attempt to answer this question. The central argument of this thesis is that military elite behavior shaped regime trajectories in the Arab Spring. Where the armed forces as an institution defected from the incumbent, the presidency immediately collapsed; where at least some military elites remained loyal, the respective chief executives survived in office for a significantly longer period. I develop an explanation that focuses on the presence of regime cronies within the military leadership. Where such cronies exist, the costs of defection increase for all members of the officer corps. Since the loyalty of cronies appears as a forgone conclusion, defection would likely lead to confrontation within the military. In other words, the absence of crony officers is a necessary condition for the cohesive defection of the armed forces from authoritarian presidents. Empirically, the fact that there were no crony officers in their respective militaries enabled the Egyptian and Tunisian armed forces to defect from their commanders in chief without endangering their internal cohesion. In Syria and Yemen, on the other hand, the defection of the armed forces as an institution was not an option given the fact that key units in both militaries were controlled by officers closely connected to the president. The result was the swift collapse of personalist presidencies in Egypt and Tunisia and the escalation of conflict in Syria and Yemen. This thesis traces the emergence of patterns of political-military relations in Egypt, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen from regime foundation in the 1950s and 1960s to the uprisings of 2010 and 2011. I argue that path dependent processes of institutional development link patterns of political-military relations at the outbreak of the uprisings to the dynamics of regime foundation in the early 20th century. While the institutional form of the founding regimes that II emerged in the 1950s and 1960s was a function of the composition of regime coalitions, the patterns of political-military relations that shaped regime trajectories in 2011 were shaped by attempts to reproduce these initial institutional features over time and under changing environmental conditions. The initial role of the armed forces in founding regimes was determined by whether or not the regime coalition had drawn institutional support from the military. Where this was the case as in Egypt and Syria, the military developed into a central regime institution, whereas the armed forces remained marginal in Tunisia and institutionally weak in Yemen. These initial differences were reproduced in the context of a period of institutional and economic reform from the second half of the 1970s onwards. While all four regimes succeeded in reining in the military, they used different strategies that had different and partially unintended consequences. In Egypt the depoliticization of the military was sugarcoated by the emergence of a parallel &lsquo;officers&rsquo; republic&rsquo; that ensured substantial military autonomy, in Syria the armed forces were controlled via a system of praetorian units, while in Tunisia the military remained marginal but largely independent from the regime and in Yemen tribal dynamics prevented the army from developing into a strong institution. These processes all fulfilled their primary goal of ensuring that the armed forces would not actively intervene in politics. At the same time, however, they produced different incentive structures for military elites confronted with regime threatening protests."

MNEs are discussed as they link the economy of the host country with the global economy by their regional and global networks. The expansion and successful embeddedness of West European multinational firms is crucial for the industrial integration of CEECs into the EU. The focus of the study is on the largest food processing companies, which invested in the region : namely Nestl&eacute;, Unilever and InBev. The dissertation discusses the motives of investment and the entry strategies of food MNEs, outlines their contribution to the local development and stresses the national actors as forces to embedded FDI. The research discovered that EU membership facilitated the processes of global reorganizations of Nestl&eacute;, Unilever and InBev in CEE. All of the three MNEs, which form the object of this research, closed partially or completely plants all over CEE (and Western Europe). Hence, in a liberal trade regime it is very difficult to talk about long-term embeddedness of MNEs. It seems that the global strategies of the companies and the size of the market are the factor, which pre-determines the level of embeddedness of food MNEs in a certain economy and not so much the national actors and institutions."

It is a means by which the political sphere re-balances intolerable inequalities and outcomes that have occurred within the market.

It finds that statewide parties have adopted different territorial strategies to confront the common challenge of multi-level coordination in a decentralised political system. Regional branches of statewide parties increasingly respond to the competitive pressures emerging from sub-national party systems, rather than the preferences of the national leadership, although the interests of national and regional elites may often coincide. Regional party systems in both countries are diverging in their structures of competition, not only from the national level but also from each other. This is closely related to the different types of electoral challenge posed by the main non-statewide parties in these regions. The methodological design consists of two national frameworks and four regional case studies, two in Italy (Campania, Lombardia) and two in Spain (Andalusia, Galicia). These are linked through the use of comparable empirical indicators over a similar timeframe. The national frameworks required the compilation of a new data-set on regional elections in Italy and Spain, a detailed analysis of party statutes and their evolution, and a full exploration of the secondary literature in different languages. The regional case studies required extensive archival analysis of the main national newspapers and their regional editions, reinforced by a series of in-depth interviews with political actors in all four regions. The case studies found strong empirical evidence concerning the distinctive character of presidentialism at regional level; the continued importance of clientelism in shaping political relations at subnational levels; the pursuit of autonomist strategies by regional branches of statewide parties; the variety of competitive strategies adopted by non-statewide parties; the role of regional arenas as battlegrounds for national factional disputes; and the importance of local coalition testing for subsequent coalitional choices at regional level. The comparative conclusions serve to consolidate these findings, as well as to reflect on further avenues for research in this rapidly developing field."

The multidimensional approach means that in addition to income, other more direct indicators of livingstandard deprivation are taken into account. Using empirical data from the European Community Household Panel and European Social Survey, the thesis explores crosscountry differences in the patterns of poverty and social exclusion and explains them in terms of the characteristics of societies and welfare systems. The research also explores the interrelations between various aspects of disadvantage and identifies its most severe forms. A number of more specific research questions are also addressed in three empirical chapters of the dissertation. The first of these chapters investigates the cross-national differences in the risk of multidimensional poverty among low skilled workers and the unemployed, as well as the level of protection against poverty offered by different patterns of labour participation within households (dual earner, single earner, and so-called one-and-a half-earner models). It finds that more redistributive countries, and those spending more on social protection, perform better in terms of lowering the risk of poverty among people with relatively vulnerable positions in the labour market, even when controlling for the size of economy. The second investigates the cross-national differences in the circumstances of certain groups particularly at risk of poverty: older people, single parents, large families and people with poor health. The evidence suggests that welfare regimes differ in their ability to protect these risk groups from multidimensional poverty, and that their performance depends on the type of risk represented by specific category. Countries of social-democratic and conservative regime types are found to offer good protection for those affected by labour market-related risks, but they perform relatively poorly in the case of more individualized, biography-related risks. The last empirical chapter shifts the focus from poverty to social exclusion by investigating the relationships between lack of resources, poor social participation and dissatisfaction with life, the focus again being on cross-national differences in the revealed patterns. The results demonstrate that the poor are relatively more likely to be socially detached and dissatisfied with life in more affluent societies. Also, lack of social participation is found to have an effect on dissatisfaction with life independent from poverty, and the effect is found to be stronger in more prosperous countries. Overall, the research demonstrates a substantial variation in the prevalence and the patterns of multidimensional poverty across Europe, with Southern-European countries having the highest rates and the Nordic countries and The Netherlands performing best. However, the research also provides evidence for a greater polarization between the poor and the non-poor in the countries where the incidence of poverty is less frequent. It is suggested that these greater contrasts may stem from different patterns of selection into the category of poor operating in those more affluent countries."

The basic assumption is that visibility in the media is crucial to become recognized and thus valuable social and political subjects. This is especially true for resource-poor groups of activists at the margins of the political field who aim to introduce new social problems into the public arena. Compared to past decades, however, visibility today holds a different meaning, and passes through different channels due to the emergence of information and communication technologies which have transformed mainstream-dominated media systems into more nuanced and complex media environments. The dissertation is based on an interdisciplinary analysis about how social and political actors involved ingrassroots mobilizations against insecure employment in Italy and Europe seek visibility at the public level by acting in complex, multilayered media environments. In doing so, the dissertation presents three relevant novelties in two strands of literature: social movements studies and communication/media studies. At first, the analysis revolves around the concept of activist media practices and three important dimensions that emerged from the investigation: media representation of activists and mobilizations; activists&rsquo; perceptions of the media environment; and interactions between social movements and the media. The former and the latter have been addressed in the literature, but separately and without comparing how they develop with regard to different types of media outlets. Scholars in the field, moreover, do not usually consider activists&rsquo; perceptions of the media environment, despite the relevance this dimension has for understanding activist media practices. Second, the analysis is based on a comparative research design which takes into consideration three territorial levels (transnational, national and local), three types of media outlets (mainstream, sympathetic and alternative, with the second never having been empirically explored in studies about social movements and the media), and a number of media technologies (from the press to the Internet). The dissertation compares a broad range of (activist) media practices which the existing literature in the field considers separately, while in reality they develop in parallel and often intertwine. Third, the empirical research on which the dissertation is based deals with a critical area of investigation, the realm of insecure and precarious jobs. Despite the fact that this issue has already been addressed by several disciplines, including the sociology of work and industrial relations, there is only a sporadic and fragmented body of literature about mobilizations of precarious workers in Italy and Europe. After a theoretical and methodological introduction, the dissertation empirically explores the three above-mentioned dimensions of activist media practices in complex media environments. Conclusions recompose the three dimensions of activist media practices (representation, perception and recognition) in complex media environments, taking into consideration the literature on the sociology of practices and insights from two relevant theoretical approaches: field theory and actor network theory. Additionally, the conclusions discuss the empirical and theoretical validity of three relevant concepts in the field of media and social movements: 'sympathetic media', the 'discursive opportunity structure' and the 'communication repertoire'."

Why are interest groups not as successful as they would like to be?","2011","ROZBICKA, Patrycja",NA,"Some interest groups, when referring to their participation in EU policy processes, summarize their experience thus: &lsquo;We are more and more consulted but less and less heard&rsquo;. While the governance concept in general, and EU multi-level governance in particular, argue for the inclusion of interest groups in the policy process, those groups&rsquo; statements prove that in reality the situation is different. The questions that must be answered, then, are: why does this happen, and where is the catch? This thesis examines the EU&rsquo;s relationships with interest groups in general, and, in particular, the factors supporting and opposing NGOs&rsquo; and business groups&rsquo; successes and failures in influencing EU policies. I seek to answer the following questions: How does the organization of the EU political system assist or limit NGOs&rsquo; and business groups&rsquo; participation in the policy process? Does their position in policy networks have any influence on their input transposition? Does it affect the quality of their input? Can external factors to the policy processes themselves be a reason for lack of input implementation? I focus on three case studies. Firstly, as a background study, I examine the EU political system; subsequently, I analyze the EU Sustainable Development Policy and the EU Regulation on chemicals and their safe use (REACH) as particular examples of &lsquo;on-the-ground&rsquo; cases. My main methodologies are process-tracing (including comparative content text analysis), social-network analysis, and interviews with key informants. The results are striking. The EU political environment does not appear to be as open as its supporters would like it to be perceived. Coalition-building proves to be the most efficient element of successful interest-group campaigns. The quality and independence of the input of interest groups is questionable. And finally, it emerges that external factors, which should be irrelevant, have a major influence &ndash; both positive and negative &ndash; on groups&rsquo; input transposition, depending on the situation."

Caramani provides a multi-pronged empirical analysis through time, across countries, and between party families. The inclusion in the analysis of all the most important social and political cleavages - class, state-church, rural-urban, ethno-linguistic and religious - allows him to assess the nationalizing impact of the class cleavage that emerged from national and industrial revolutions, and the resistance of preindustrial cultural factors to national integration. Institutional and socio-economic factors are combined with actor-centered patterns and differences between national types of territorial configurations of the vote."

The thesis has sought to make a contribution to the study of nationalism by conceptualising nationalist claims as an event that occurs within a specific temporal and geographical framework rather than as essential propositions derived from a static nationalist ideology. The analytical approach suggested by the thesis attempts to move beyond the main paradigmatic debates of the literature of nationalism studies by conducting a theoretically informed historical analysis that seeks to contextualise local events within the wider framework of the international order. The argument has been developed by following a chronological narrative that incorporates a comparative analysis of the main political parties and actors in the Croatian parliament between 1908 and 1918. The gradual erosion of allegiance to the Monarchy was a long and protracted process that saw the gradual abandonment of the concept of Croatian state right for the principle of ethno-national self-determination. But the main objectives of all variants of Croatian nationalism remained the reform of the constitutional arrangements in Austria-Hungary until almost the very end of its existence. It was only with the realisation that the Monarchy would cease to exist that the decision to accept unification with Serbia became an acceptable option. By showing how contingency and external events shape the preferences, claims and arguments of local elites, the argument hopes to highlight the need to focus on case studies that include the international dimension as an integral component of the field of nationalism studies. From a historiographical point of view, the emphasis on the lack of inevitability of outcomes hopes that this analysis will sit uncomfortably with the grand narratives that have emerged about the creation of the first Yugoslavia, be it those who see as inevitable and those who see it as inherently bound to fail from the outset."

My point of departure is the puzzling observation that, in matters of membership, states not only differentiate between citizens and foreigners, but also between different categories of foreigners, as well as between different categories of citizens. In the first part of this work, I explore possible justifications for boundaries of membership. I look into arguments of justice, nationalism, liberalism and democracy in order to identify principles for demarcating boundaries and for assessing various claims of inclusion/exclusion. In the second part, I address more specific questions related to the regulation of admission to citizenship. For this purpose, I examine a set of concrete rules of citizenship presently enforced by 27 EU countries. My proposal is to overcome the boundary problem by shifting the focus from the constitution of the boundary towards policies of boundary making. I affirm the principle of general openness of membership that is intended to provide normative corrections to the actual structure of boundaries. Against the common view that perceives citizenship as a fruit that is soft on the inside and hard on the outside, I argue that citizenship should be seen as soft on the inside and even softer on the outside. In order to respond to different claims of admission, I suggest breaking up the unitary concept of citizenship and distinguishing between legal, political, and identity memberships. This proposal is not meant to weaken or devaluate citizenship, but to reaffirm its essentially political value. By rejecting ideas of automatic and inherited citizenship and by insisting upon democratic recognition and commitment to political membership, I aim at recasting admission to citizenship as a transformative process through which individuals not merely receive membership but become members in a political community."

First, it has not removed the &lsquo;eastern security dilemma&rsquo; which underpinned Polish, Czech and Hungarian quest for NATO membership. Second, it did not strengthen NATO political cohesion and military effectiveness. To support the argument the study mobilizes the concept of the &lsquo;security community&rsquo; developed by Karl Deutsch in 'Political community and North Atlantic Area'. On the account of Deutsch&rsquo;s concept the study approaches NATO as a security community. It sees therefore the NATO expansion through the prism of extending three features which characterize a security community: the meaning and nature of &lsquo;trust&rsquo;; &lsquo;security&rsquo;, and community&rsquo;s capabilities (i.e. its &lsquo;power&rsquo; and &lsquo;responsiveness&rsquo;). Because of the nature of these constructs, enlargement policy should not been seen as a one way process where candidates simply adjust to NATO practices and implement alliance&rsquo;s rules and norms, but as a process of mutual learning and socialisation. For that reason NATO enlargement was a process of rebuilding the community; it challenged the community identity, its security concept, relationships among members, and also community capabilities; &lsquo;power&rsquo; and &lsquo;responsiveness&rsquo;. Against this preposition, the study claims that the policy of NATO enlargement created a strategic ambiguity. First, a &lsquo;trusting-relation&rsquo; developed only between candidates and community core of strength, that is the US. Second, rather than forge a new &lsquo;concept of security&rsquo; the enlarged NATO accommodated competing visions of the alliance security. Third, new members failed to meet enlargement criteria pertaining to NATO capabilities due to the institutional and economic ineffectiveness and flaws in the NATO conditionality policy. As a result of it, NATO enlargement sharpened and multiplied alliance&rsquo;s problems, weakened its political cohesion, and thus confronted the new members with politically and militarily challenges they were not prepared for. All this seems to contribute to NATO identity crisis and a growing feeling of insecurity among Central European NATO members."

Through a cross-national comparative study utilizing mixed methods, this research finds that the far right promotes policies aimed at protecting nature based on the connection of organic nationalism and political ecology, challenging perceptions in academia and society that the protection of nature is a leftwing issue or the domain of left-wing parties, and that far right positions regarding ecological issues are incompatible, oppositional, hostile, indifferent, and/or incoherent. Organic nationalist connections with the protection of nature, present at least from Romanticism to National Socialism, provide a theoretical framework to explain the position of contemporary far right parties, including the integration of elements of a critique of Judeo-Christian and Enlightenment ideas and subsequent modern developments perceived as breaking the cherished harmony between man and nature. Influenced by elements of this ecological worldview of organic nationalists of anti-anthropocentrism, organicism, and the sanctity and supremacy of nature, contemporary far right parties promote many ecological goals. A quantitative analysis of manifesto, media, and expert survey data and qualitative analysis of party documents indicate that nature protection for the far right is salient, fundamental, and comprehensive, particularly permeating a number of policy areas, including agriculture, animals, conservation, economics, energy, fish, immigration, individualism, international relations, science and technology, spatial planning, traditional culture, transportation, and waste management, and many associated sub-issues. Furthermore, a case study on Austria reveals that nature protection also remains an important priority for far right activity in a legislature. Overall, far right parties located further right on the political spectrum, or more organic nationalist, are more supportive of the protection of nature and adhere to a more ecological perspective."

How (to what extent) autonomous is the Commission, which sources and causal mechanisms bring this autonomy to bear, and have these sources changed over time? Which is the most effective mechanism of control available to member states in the Council to rein in the Commission? These are the three interrelated questions addressed by this study. Concerning the first question, I find that the Commission focuses on inte-gration issues. These are primarily found in the joint bodies established by the underly-ing agreements as well as the number of substantive issues mentioned therein. On ques-tion number two, I find that the Commission distinctly shapes BTAs slightly over 50 per-cent of the time. The primary source of Commission autonomy in the 1970s and 1980s was asymmetric information, i.e. the Commission having greater knowledge about all contingencies in the negotiations than the member states. More recently, Commission autonomy is better captured by its agenda-setting power, here defined as its ability to put before the Council an agreement that member states can vote only either up-or-down. With regard to question three I find that, initially, member states&rsquo; credible threat of non-ratification provided the most effective backstop to the Commission running lose. Over time, member states have stepped up monitoring mechanisms to take control of negotiations earlier, making direct oversight the most important tool for Council control. I examine and expound this argument by adopting a Principal-Agent (PA) perspective and process-tracing methodology against the backdrop of six in-depth case studies se-lected in accordance with objective and replicable criteria, of which five are retained for the final analysis. In conclusion, I join the camp of scholars making the case for a significant independent causal influence of the Commission on European public policy out-comes."

The unilateral approach taken by the United States and the extraterritorial character of its homeland security measures have resulted in severe conflicts at the transatlantic level. What is puzzling is that despite the societal, political and legal divergences, the EU-US cooperation on homeland security did not slow down, but to the contrary managed to avoid deadlocks and became even more dynamic. The major objective of this research is therefore to understand how to avoid deadlocks in the process of policy-making even despite diverging approaches, ideas, etc. This thesis is an exploratory study of the EU-US homeland security cooperation, with a particular focus on the negotiations of the Passenger Name Records Agreements. The answer offered in this research is twofold. I argue that the shift towards networks and new forms of governance which they stimulate (i.e. soft law instruments) were the reasons why potential deadlocks in transatlantic policy-making were avoided. The basic assumption I make in this research is that the existence of conflict and cooperation in transatlantic homeland security cannot be explained without abandoning the realist assumption that states are unitary actors and the only ones capable of making decisions. Furthermore, I argue that the shift towards networks and the processes within networks were not apolitical. This provides some insights into the instances of conflicts. Following Deborah Stone, the process of policy making in this research is understood as &lsquo;a struggle over ideas&rsquo;. I argue that in case of transatlantic homeland security this struggle took place within networks which are political bodies in the sense that decisions about their functioning and evolution are politically motivated and impact the overall relationship. Therefore, I introduce the concept of &lsquo;network politics&rsquo; with reference to the process whereby members of a network attempt to impact the policy process and outcomes through promoting their own ideas. It is through the prism of the network politics that both deadlocks and enhanced decision making capacities can be better understood. In my exploration of transatlantic governance and network politics I focus on three elements: membership, centrality of actors and the role of bureaucrats."

Committees, networks and EU agencies mushroomed in order to fulfill different regulatory functions. The thesis aims at explaining the variation of these delegation patterns between sectors and over time. Combining an innovative and refined functional-institutionalist approach and power-distributional factors, the thesis first argues that the distribution of implementing competences has a crucial effect on the delegation pattern. While nationally based implementation would explain the establishment of EU regulatory networks, expert committees would be found where most implementing competences are in the hands of the Commission. Second, the gradual reinforcement of networks and committees up to their possible transformation into EU agencies is addressed by a dynamic relationship between functional and distributional forces unfolding over time through feedback loops. Keen on keeping their power, policy-makers set up weak agents before expanding their power at a later stage after realizing they lacked the means to achieve the policy objectives assigned to them. The empirical analysis, based on three case studies (the regulation of food safety, electricity and telecommunications) confirms and completes the conjectures by pointing at additional factors such as the presence of independent regulatory agencies at the national level, the technicality of the sector and sociological pressure. In addition to providing a wealth of new insights on regulatory delegation in the EU, the thesis offers a sophisticated adaptation of the principal-agent framework in multiple principals configurations and makes a strong case for refining the conceptualization of functional pressure and colouring the study of institutional choice, otherwise dominated by distributional and institutional factors, with a revamped functional approach."

Territorial Strategies and the uses of European Integration by Political Parties in Scotland, Bavaria and Sardinia 1979-2005","2007","HEPBURN, Eve","Political parties -- European Union countries; Regionalism -- European Union countries","European integration has upset many assumptions regarding the distribution of power, functions and authority across and within states. Scholars have bewailed or rejoiced the &lsquo;emptying&rsquo; of the state &ndash; the erosion of its competences by supranational integration and decentralisation. However, there are few examinations of how substate actors have responded to state and European structural change, and none that have analysed how substate political parties have sought to enhance regional powers and influence during a period in which state boundaries have become permeable. This research fills this lacuna by exploring how substate parties in Scotland, Bavaria and Sardinia have pursued territorial strategies to secure autonomy and capacity in Europe since 1979. The choice of comparing dissimilar regions enables us to explore the uneven effects of European integration in different places, and to examine why some parties have used Europe to advance their territorial projects whilst others have not. Territorial strategies &ndash; which include demands for constitutional recognition as well as policy capacity &ndash; differ across territories and party systems, owing to a variety of local and statewide factors. They also change over time in response to perceived opportunities for action in Europe. For instance, from 1988-95 the possibilities of a Europe of the Regions led to a convergence of territorial demands, causing nationalist parties to moderate claims to independence and pro-centralist parties to support greater substate autonomy. However, the closing of opportunities for regions from the late 1990s caused some parties to revert back to previous &ndash; or more Eurosceptical &ndash; positions, or to trade-off autonomy for more access to the state. This indicates that substate party support for European integration is often tactical, whilst pressures for autonomy are motivated by the perception of policy benefits to be obtained, with or without Europe."

This thesis takes up the challenge of investigating how trends towards global democratization or technocratization play out in the field of United Nations peacebuilding. To do so the thesis argues that democratic optimism and technocratic pessimism should not be evaluated as competing paradigms, but as panoramas whose interplay needs to be investigated in empirical research. A pragmatist standpoint, conceptualized as 'critical optimism' is taken and a framework drawing on sociological theories of practice developed. To scrutinize democratizing and technocratizing tendencies the study of everyday ordering practices in different organizational sites is proposed. In adopting an interpretative research strategy three sites are scrutinized empirically: The United Nations Peacebuilding Commission, the United Nations Peacekeeping Best Practice Section and the Afghanistan Compact and its Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board. The interplay of different political practices at these sites is reconstructed. The discussion reveals the importance of democratic and technocratic ideas, yet demonstrates that no clear-cut tendency towards one mode can be observed. Instead, different practices work in parallel, sometimes support each other and sometimes conflict with each other. Taken together, the importance of scrutinizing the difficile interplay of practices is highlighted and the significance of taking pluralist standpoints in studying the social life of world politics is demonstrated. The thesis makes three core contributions to the literature. Firstly, the thesis is one of the first attempts at seeking a dialogue between critical and liberal theories of global governing, otherwise often seen as competitors. Secondly, through its development of theory it makes a contribution to the debate on how sociological frameworks drawing on theories of practice can be used to study the international. Thirdly, its empirical results contribute to the research agenda on how peacebuilding is organized in practice."

An indication of this shift is the nature of the policies promoted by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD, which encourages bilateral donors that work with fragile states to adopt a whole-of-government approach, i.e. to develop cross-departmental cooperation between defence, diplomacy and development administrations. The question as to why some bilateral donors implement such integrated approaches to confront challenges in fragile states, while others only do so marginally or not at all still remains. Neither the existing literatures on security or development cultures nor the current securitization theories are able to explain the different levels and patterns of implementation of these specific OECD/DAC recommendations. In this thesis, I use the concept of &ldquo;the organization of hypocrisy&rdquo; to understand the complex relationship, and often the discrepancy, that exists between &ldquo;talk&rdquo; and &ldquo;action&rdquo; in the policy attempts to link security and development. Donor organizations are routinely confronted with the security and development demands of various actors. They need to act to produce results, and include such activities as contributing to UN peacekeeping missions to increase the country in question&rsquo;s chances for development, or deciding who should be the beneficiaries of aid without fostering conflict. Producing these desired outcomes is not always possible however. Consequently, donor organizations &ldquo;talk&rdquo; about coherence, but are unable to &ldquo;act&rdquo; coherently and therefore to adapt their strategies and their policies. I compare France, Germany, the UK and the EU as donors &ndash; in particular in their roles in North and South Sudan, but also in selected West African countries &ndash; in an attempt to understand which factors favour a higher level of &ldquo;action&rdquo; with regard to the security-development nexus. I argue that bureaucracies cannot be studied in isolation from their complex and often inconsistent environment. The ability of the diplomacy, defence and development sectors to integrate their administrations and policies depends on the consistency of their environment and on their institutional ability to collectively find an acceptable convention that is capable of balancing development, diplomacy and defence norms. Protecting the normative aims of development policy is the key to achieving a higher level of integration in some OECD/DAC donor countries as well as to cultivating the formation of synergies between security and development policies."

In addressing this question, this dissertation explores whether politicians, supervisors and bankers change their preferences towards financial markets when they recognize they have made significant mistakes in the recent past. It also asks whether such recognition of failure leads to a process of change in rules, policies and institutions, in different national contexts. In addressing this broader theoretical question, the dissertation focuses on the mortgage credit markets in advanced capitalist economies. Challenging the conventional approaches in political science and financial economics, it shows that the longitudinal and cross-sectional variations in mortgage credit markets can best be explained with reference to nations' different experiences of financial crisis. Borrowing insights from learning theory in political economy and public policy analysis, it argues specifically that those nations (i) that had severe financial crises in their recent past and (ii) that have coordinative institutions and elites, are more likely to draw lessons from their mistakes, and to change their policies, in order to avoid similar asset bubbles and financial crises in the future. This dissertation adopts a multi-method approach in examining the role of learning in the evolution of mortgage credit markets. A significant part traces the history of mortgage credit and financial crises in three countries, from a comparative perspective. Stressing a comparison between two institutionally similar countries, Sweden and Denmark, the dissertation shows how differences in the severity of crises may yield opposite outcomes in elite perceptions toward financial stability, and how they explain the differences in policy and market outcomes. On the other hand, comparing Sweden to Britain -two countries with similar crisis history but with different institutions- it stresses the positive role of coordinative institutions and coherent elites in translating the crisis experience into actual policy and institutional change. In addition to the comparative-historical analysis, the econometric parts of dissertation show that the inferences drawn from three cases can be generalized to a sample of 19 OECD countries. The results indicate that the countries with a negative experience of financial crisis in the early 1990s are more likely to have smaller mortgage markets in comparison to other countries, and that this effect is stronger in countries with coordinative economic and policy institutions."

In a year characterized by intense mobilizations throughout the world &ndash; with the Occupy, the 15-M and the so called Arab Spring protests dominating the scene &ndash; the main Italian organizations and networks coalesced, with the external support of some small declining or newly formed parties, and gradually captured an increasing attention in society. The main environment of action of the Referendum supporters slowly passed from the Italian streets, assemblies, and squares, to the websites of the organizations, and &ndash; during the very last phase of the campaign &ndash; to Facebook, finally conquering at least in part the very closed space of the Italian mass media. On Facebook, in particular, the politically oriented communication of the referendum supporters proved to be very pervasive: the words referendum and quorum were the most present in the statuses of the Italian users of this platform for the entire 2011. The dissertation explores in detail this successful campaign, focusing on how the activists elaborated new strategies of online communication and on the processes of adaptation that the emergence of the Social Media in the Italian political environment promoted in this social movement milieu. Adopting a very wide set of methodologies, which includes Digital Ethnography, Social Network Analysis, interviews and data collection through computer programming in Python, the author explores different aspects of the mobilization that are particularly relevant for the broader discussion on online activism and campaigning. In particular, he traces the network of websites that supported the campaign, he observes the online communication practices of the activists on the web and Facebook, he describes the link that connects online and off-line activism during this large-scale campaign, and he connects the different ways of perceiving the social media environment with divergent uses of these platforms."

The research is divided into three stages: comparative website analysis, quantitative analysis and case studies. Looking at 93 state Legislatures in Brazil, Spain and the United States, each of the stages of the research presents findings that contribute to the literature on e-democracy and open government. The comparative website analysis shows a varying degree of development amongst state Legislature websites. This heterogeneous level of development is contrasted with a common denominator amongst most websites: while the majority of efforts are towards the provision of Legislative information, the prospects for participation and deliberation are extremely limited. Standing out against these rather predictable results, findings also suggest that certain institutional traits such as electoral systems may influence the design of websites in terms of both their content and features. The quantitative analyses single out a number of factors that influence the differences in levels of development of Legislative websites. First of all, contrary to what has been suggested by a portion of the e-democracy literature, neither resources nor partisanship seem to matter for the development of Legislative websites. Conversely, the quantitative findings suggest that matters of institutional design (e.g. parliaments&rsquo; autonomy) and demand (e.g. Internet access, population) may play a significant role in the performance of Parliamentary websites. The case studies - the core of this research - follow an institutional approach to the process of ICT usage within public organizations, through a detailed analysis of the inner workings of three different Legislatures in Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Norte). This analysis evinces the role played by factors largely ignored by the majority of the e-democracy research until now. It shows how the different institutional arrangements ultimately shape the very configuration of websites, impacting each of them in terms of their features and contents. By reversing this interpretation, we surmise, the configuration of Legislative websites per se may provide external observers with information regarding institutional arrangements and policy-innovation cycles and processes within a Legislature. iv Finally, the comparative perspective taken sheds light on the role played by civil servants in the technological enactment process within Legislatures. All other things being equal, it is the relationships among civil servants and MPs, and the relationships between the two groups - mediated by institutional arrangements - that will ultimately affect the level of development of parliamentary websites."

Under which conditions do they decide to keep this cooperation informal, and when do they instead prefer to formalise it through an international treaty? Why do government seem to be more capable to produce regional public goods in some policy-areas than in others? The present research addresses these questions by analysing the contemporary South American-wide regionalism from 2000 to 2014, the period in which the Initiative for the Integration of Regional Infrastructure in South America (IIRSA) was created and later formalised into the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR). First, the analysis of the intergovernmental negotiations shows that an informal institution such as IIRSA better accommodated the preferences of governments that were searching for and experimenting with a collective response to an external challenge, whereas a formal institution such as UNASUR better accommodated the preferences of governments that wanted to avoid the emergence of competitive regional projects and the defection of some states. Second, the thesis examines the interactions between governments and transnational actors and shows that regional public goods are more likely to be produced in policy-areas in which governments were able to broker non-state transnational actors to implement basic intergovernmental consensus. In answering these questions, the thesis offers an empirically informed assessment of contemporary South American regionalism without following either the over-optimistic or over-pessimistic viewpoints that dominate the current academic debate."

Extant theories fail to provide sound answers. Realist approaches, for example, under-predict the recurrence of regime change if great powers should have no reason to intervene in weaker states, or over-predict it if anything goes under anarchy. Similarly, democracy promotion arguments overstate the causal importance of the US desire to expand liberty globally. This dissertation presents a novel explanation for the recurrence of regime change in US foreign policy, arguing that the practice of regime change is predicated upon what I call 'emotional frustration', an anger-arousing emotional state that is brought about by a foreign leader's obstructive behavior perceived to be rooted in implacable hatred. While obstruction is ubiquitous in interstate interactions, I claim that the combination of hegemonic expectations towards a target state and the perception of hatred shape the extent to which a foreign leader's conduct evokes an emotional response on the part of foreign policy elites. Once emotionally frustrated, regime change becomes an attractive foreign policy instrument to decision-makers who seek a way to confront and put a stop to the obstruction of a menacing target state. It enables frustrated leaders both to permanently get rid of a perceivedly hostile foreign leader and to discharge their frustration through the use of force. Illustrating the importance of emotional frustration, I conduct four historical case studies based on primary sources, spanning almost one hundred years of US history. Regime changes in Cuba (1906), Nicaragua (1909&ndash;12), the Dominican Republic (1965), and Iraq (2003) reveal overlooked patterns of emotional frustration that have time and again animated regime change decisions."

It aims to account for the inconsistent record of success of international actors in their attempts to institute and implement powersharing agreements in Bosnia and Cyprus. In particular, the thesis focuses on the impact of international incentives on the policies and discourse of the Bosnian Serb and the Turkish Cypriot secessionist elite in respect to the post-conflict state unification agenda. Much of the literature on third-party sponsored conflict management is optimistic about the possibility for conflict resolution through external intervention, especially in states offered the prospect of EU membership. The confidence in the transformative power of international incentives relies on the presumption that there is sufficient willingness and ability on the &lsquo;external&rsquo; side to apply its leverage in support of policies that would promote more consensual inter-ethnic relations in aspiring member states. A further presumption posited by the literature, is that domestic socialisation into international/EU normative framework can yield discursive and identity changes in aspiring member states, in turn decreasing the salience of borders and reducing the potential for ethno-territorial conflict. What is missing from many of these studies is a more empirically driven discussion of problems related to the &lsquo;exercise of power&rsquo; by a multiplicity of international actors in postconflict, deeply divided societies, typically characterised by a low level of democratic consolidation. The thesis attempts to make a contribution by filling this gap through an indepth study of interaction between the international actors and domestic elite in the autonomous entities of Bosnia and Cyprus, offering a more context-based approach to the preferences and conduct of actors on both sides of the power relationship. Central to the analysis of domestic preferences is how the exercise of the autonomy in an illiberal context, and the rent-seeking opportunities which the elite enjoys in such a setting, affect the positions of the ruling elite on the state-consolidation agenda. Nationalist elites are found to be instrumental players who hold vested interests in maintaining the status quo and are endowed with various institutional and discursive opportunities which frequently allow them to resist and delegitimize internationally sponsored reforms. As such, the thesis outlines multiple domestic challenges related to the exercise of &lsquo;hard power&rsquo; and legitimacy the outsiders face in post-conflict interventions. Further question pursued is the extent to which international actors are capable of meeting these challenges through a coordinated strategy, how the available resources of power are applied in practice, how effective these are given the domestic institutional opportunity structures, and finally, what degree of legitimacy international actors are able to confer to their interventions. Significant normative and practical constraints to mobilising, effectively applying resources, and legitimising international intervention are identified. As a result of these domestic challenges and external constraints, the thesis proposes an alternative view of the interaction between external and domestic actors in post-conflict contexts to that presented by conventional IR approaches, which generally conceptualise it as power asymmetry in favour of the former. This relationship is better described as ongoing bargaining, as well as what I refer to as a legitimacy contest, more akin to the Morgenthau&rsquo;s understanding of power as a psychological relationship, of which legitimacy is an important component. Further, contrary to the idea that external policy is fixed and that the domestic actors follow a straightforward logic of either obstruction or compliance, this interaction is seen as an ongoing contestation, in which both sides use various strategies to pursue and legitimize their agendas, frequently adapting their positions and often deviating from stated policy objectives and official rhetoric."

At certain times, a party may rule out all political cooperation with a particular other party. In these cases, there is only conflict between the parties. This dissertation is about such situations. I define the systematic refusal of a particular party to cooperate politically with a particular other party as the party&rsquo;s ostracism of the other party. It is the causes and consequences of ostracism that I wish to explain in this thesis. In order to do so, I first define the concepts of the &lsquo;anti-immigration party&rsquo; and the &lsquo;communist party.&rsquo; Based on both a literature review and an expert survey, conducted in the course of this study, I classify other parties&rsquo; responses to the existence of 46 anti-immigration and communist parties in 15 countries in postwar Western Europe as either &lsquo;ostracism&rsquo; or &lsquo;no ostracism.&rsquo; In the first part of this dissertation, I use the resulting classification as the dependent variable in a comparative-empirical analysis, in order to explain the variation in other parties&rsquo; political responses to particular political parties. Using logistic regression analysis on the basis of two different data sets, I find that other parties are likely to systematically boycott a far right party if they do not need to cooperate with it anyway. They are even more likely to do so if it holds anti-democratic ideologies. The &lsquo;ostracism&rsquo; / &lsquo;no ostracism&rsquo; classification is the main independent variable in the second part of the research, which aims at exploring the consequences of the exclusion of political parties for their electoral support. I argue and empirically demonstrate, by way of different regression analysis techniques on the basis of 15 different data sets, that when ostracized, anti-immigration and communist parties are less able to affect policy outcomes, which is what generally interests voters. As a result, these parties lose votes. There is one main exception to this rule. Anti-immigration parties that operate in a political context where opposition influence in parliament is high, and which are represented in the national parliament, are immune to the deleterious impact of ostracism on their electoral support. It seems that these parties can exercise power over policy-making in spite of being ostracized, thereby remaining attractive to voters. Thus, institutional factors determine whether or not ostracizing a rival party is an effective tool in the hands of targeting parties in order to safeguard democracy - or just to hold on to power."

Understanding how citizens reason and how they make their decisions is ever more important as the use of direct democratic instruments is growing throughout the world. I propose a concept of citizen competence based on reason-giving. A competent citizen is one who bases his or her decisions on substantive, policy-related arguments, and who considers a diversity of arguments before taking a decision. In this thesis I use a multi-method approach, combining three different datasets to analyze citizen competence in direct democracy: cross-sectional post-ballot surveys from 34 popular votes in Switzerland; a panel dataset covering two referendum campaigns in Switzerland; and a lab experiment conducted in Scotland during the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. I found, that citizens have a surprisingly accurate knowledge of the policy-related arguments of the debate. Furthermore, arguments are significantly associated with vote intention, even when controlling for party preference. This first results highlight the importance of meaningful arguments in political opinion formation. However, a second finding of my project is that citizens tend to process arguments in a biased way, preferring arguments compatible with their prior beliefs and partisan attachments, and disregarding or devaluing incompatible information. Yet this tendency for directional, motivated reasoning can be discouraged by holding individuals accountable for their views, that is, by making them justify their position to others. The conclusions I draw for the legitimacy of direct democratic decisions are mixed. While citizens are not as uninformed and minimalist as they are often depicted in public opinion research, they are still partisan and find it difficult to process information impartially. Therefore, in order to enhance the legitimacy of direct democratic procedure, providing citizens with diverse and balanced information is necessary, but not sufficient. They need to encounter an environment where they are motivated to be accurate, for example, by being expected to justify themselves to others in cross-cutting discussions."

Including environmental considerations at the early stages of policy-making, as well as acknowledging usage inter-dependencies and their impact on ecosystems, has led to the multiplication of localised participatory policies and multi-stakeholder platforms. In that context, the objective of the PhD is twofold. It aims to analyse how local politics, through political parties, influences those new participatory forms of management, especially in the implementation of EU environmental directives. On the other hand, it explores how the diffusion of participatory norms of governance affects the strategies of political parties. The results show that electoral position and territorial levels strongly condition the local politics of participatory governance. It also provides evidence that collaborative management reduces formal accountability and parties&rsquo; political discretion. In that sense, it confirms the cartelisation hypothesis: parties&rsquo; governing functions are strengthened, while participatory provisions have relocated the representation of interests outside the party system. The thesis highlights the positive effects of participation and holistic environmental approaches in terms of social regulation and transparency, especially in long-established national administrations. Yet, it questions its environmental strength, namely its capacity to solve deeply entrenched distributive dilemmas and the exclusiveness of social groups&rsquo; stakes. Even if multi-stakeholder participation must be appreciated as an empowering and more sustainable process, it is essential that practitioners and academics alike deal with its limitations and political ambiguities."

For the first time, it seemed that &lsquo;the political&rsquo; extended to other spheres of civil society beyond the traditional party channels. This thesis examines the responses of political parties to social movements in Italy and the Netherlands from the 1970s to the 1980s. Because of their closeness in terms of political identity, social movement scholars have tended to concentrate on the responses of left-wing political parties to social movements. This thesis, which also incorporates this common inquiry, also examines the responses to the social movements of the more distant center-right parties. The major questions that it attempts to answer are: did the observed political parties actually respond to the emergence of social movements? What types of responses did they engage in? What factors explain the variation in the parties&rsquo; responses? Each empirical chapter examines the individual party responses to the two most numerically significant social movements that emerged in the Italian and the Dutch national contexts. Drawing on Gamson&rsquo;s typology of social movements&rsquo; success (1975) and on further elaborations of different types of social movements&rsquo; &lsquo;impact&rsquo;, the analysis classifies different party responses by dimension (party discourse and party organization) and type (direct and indirect). Empirical results reveal how, despite the fact that party identity explains variation in the degree to which parties responded to social movements, with parties on the left showing greater responsiveness as compared to center parties, the latter did not remain unaffected by the emergence of social movements. Moreover, results show how also for the case of the leftwing parties, a total adherence to the social movements&rsquo; demands did not take place. A two-fold conclusion can be drawn. On the one hand, political parties do channel social movements&rsquo; demands, therefore satisfying their function of political representation. On the other hand though, the two worlds of political parties and social movements remain separate, as the inherent constraints of representative government only allow parties to bring forward the social movements&rsquo; demands in a mediated form, distant from the movements&rsquo; original demands."

The emergence of labour market institutions in the media production industries in the UK and Germany","2003","BAUMANN, Arne","Labor market -- Germany","This study compares labour market institutions and their emergence in the media production industries of Great Britain and Germany. The two principal institutions examined are vocational education and training patterns on the one hand and recruitment channels on the other hand. The former manage the labour market entry at the start of an individual's career while the latter govern the repeated labour market transactions between company and employee that occur throughout an individual's career. The comparison of these institutions in the two industries is based on novel labour market data for both companies' and individuals' training and employment behaviour in Germany and the UK. On a theoretical level, the comparison analyses dynamics of institutional formation and contributes to the literature on varieties of capitalism and socio-economic institutions. The examination of labour market institutions in the media industries of two countries that are generally classified as belonging to opposite types of market economy allows us to study dynamics of institutional reproduction and change. In order to map difference and similarity in institutional formation, the comparative research design is organised along two institutional variables, job titles and joint supply, and three potential causal mechanisms for institutional development, technological, societal and hierarchical embeddedness. Job titles and joint supply are constituent parts of an occupational labour market and represent different types of social norms, namely conventional and essential norms. The three types of embeddedness encapsulate environmental spheres that expose actors to different forces, deemed important for institutional development in the existing literature. Important results emerge with respect to the adequacy of training regimes in the media industry, marked by short-term employment and project production in both the UK and Germany. The British industry's further training regime emerges as superior to the German dual system of initial training in light of the large freelance workforce in both countries. With respect to institutional formation processes, the main counter-intuitive outcomes are that job titles in the German industry resemble those of its British counterpart, and that the British industry has arrived at a comprehensive joint supply regime. Contrary to predictions of the literature on varieties of capitalism, institutional dynamics on the industry level can thus deviate from their respective national parents. The cases show that institutional formation varies not primarily with differences in the national institutional set-up but with the type of institution and the uncertainty of actors in arriving at and legitimising such an institution. The less distributive the character of an institution, and the less actors need to legitimise an enforcement regime, the more independent of national institutions they become in their efforts to arrive at an institution."

Its findings indicate that the dominant trend was a move from a nonhierarchical mode of governance, including integrated developmental policy making by diverse local state and non-state actors in the early 1990s, towards fragmented and hierarchical modes of governance by the 2000s. By the time Hungary had moved closer to EU accession, non-hierarchical and inclusive institutional solutions (heterarchies) had started to disappear from micro-regional governance in comparison to the early 1990s. Only a few micro-regional collaborations could survive the Europeanization of sub-national governance. These evolutionary trends were mainly shaped by domestic factors, the EU having only indirect influence on the process through providing the central state with prerogatives near the end of the decade to control regional and sub-regional development policy. This is only part of the story, however. Pre-accession support programs had also strengthened the governance capacities of sub-national state and non-state actors and enabled local political entrepreneurs to organize micro-regional territorial development through heterarchies even in the face of asymmetric power constellations between central governments and local state and non-state actors. The basic underlying assumption of this research, based on heterodox development theories, is that there is an interplay between heterarchic governance patterns and socioeconomic development. The case studies confirm that in an unstable and swiftly changing political, economic and institutional environment, heterarchic institutional solutions are necessary to maintain at least an average developmental level or to change a development path."

I develop a new theory of the origins of associational life by a comparative historical study of popular sector/lower class associations of urban and rural populations in a set of Western European countries during the period of the 1870s-1970s. The countries under study are Sweden, Norway, Austria (strong civil society); Germany, Netherlands, Belgium (medium to high associatonal life); Britain (medium associational life); Italy, France, Spain and Portugal (weal to very weak associational life). Three political and institutional factors have shaped civil society: 1) Timing of state building and/or international status in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The latter the process of state building and/or the lower international status in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the stronger will be political parties and civil society organizations in the twentieth-century. In states that consolidated fully during the mid and late nineteenth-century and/or had been secondary states in the international system in the eighteenth-century, the pre-modern corporatist structures (e.g. guilds, religious corporate bodies) survived up to the early twentieth-century, because the pressures for resource extraction from state-builders were weaker. This in turn promoted a stronger popular sector organizational life in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. 2) State-capacity: the stronger state capacity, the stronger will be voluntary associations. States with high capacity are able to implement policies and establish goals autonomously decided by rulers. In the late nineteenth-century, one of the main functions of the state became the promotion of economic development and nationalist mobilization. For this purpose states have established partnerships with associations. This has empowered associations, through two mechanisms. First, associations have received resources, legitimacy and public status from the State, being thus able to recruit more members through the distribution of selective benefits (welfare, pensions). Second, since high capacity states are more able to impose a uniform jurisdiction and control over a territory, this will make easier for associations to expand through the whole national territory, to connect different geographical areas and more easily develop encompassing peak associations. 3) Democratization: the stronger the degree of democratization of the regime between the 1880s and the 1930s, the stronger associational life. Democratization is measured by two dimensions: 3.1) the extension of rights of participation, debate, and assembly; 3.2) the degree of parliamentarization of the regime. This refers to the control by representative bodies of the formation, decisions, personnel and policies of the executive. The stronger the parliament, the more associational leaders will seek to influence and establish links with MPs and political parties and build their own agenda according to parliamentary cycles. Since strong parliaments represent the whole nation, associations will tend to become national in scope, and as such more coordinated through the territory, with associational leaders creating links and alliances that run through several regions of the country. Moreover, in a strongly parliamentarized system parties will be also more interested in creating permanent and not episodic links with associations in order to have a higher reach to the electorate."
"http://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/18616","Patterns of Change. A Study of the Relation Between Political Participation and Institutions","2011","PETERS, Yvette",NA,"This thesis aims to explain levels and changes in levels of political participation through institutions and institutional change. Three general trends have been distinguished; a decline in &lsquo;representative&rsquo; participation, an increase in &lsquo;extra-representative&rsquo; participation, and an increase in &lsquo;direct&rsquo; participation. The notion that these trends are apparent in most established democracies is rather striking and puzzling. This study specifically contributes to the debate about the current state and health of democracy, considering that it is concerned with both system changes in democracies and levels of popular participation in these democracies. Changes in these types of participation could partly be explained by changes in the structure of the political system. Although the notion that institutions matter in political life is not debated, and their effects have been examined before, the effects of institutions have rarely been examined structurally in large-scale analyses, specifically concerning participation. In this study, three institutional elements which affect the access points and inclusiveness of the political system are considered: &lsquo;horizontal&rsquo; diffusion of responsibilities (privatisation; the creation of non-majoritarian institutions), &lsquo;vertical&rsquo; diffusion of responsibilities (decentralisation; globalisation) and &lsquo;diagonal&rsquo; diffusion of responsibilities (direct democracy institutionalisation). The main aim of this research is therefore to find to what extent changes in the political system influence levels of different forms of political participation, over time and across space. The study finds that, generally, representative participation seems to be negatively affected by privatisation, non-majoritarian institutions, globalisation, and the institutionalisation of referendums, with unclear results regarding the impact of decentralisation. Extrarepresentative participation is generally positively influenced by privatisation, nonmajoritarian institutions, decentralisation, and globalisation, while there are some mixed results concerning the influence of the institutionalisation of referendums. Finally, direct participation is negatively affected by privatisation, non-majoritarian institutions, decentralisation, and globalisation, while referendum institutionalisation has generally a positive effect on levels of direct participation."

While numerous accounts exist that analyze EU policies from a historical, analytical-descriptive and normative perspective, no existing account has studied the evolution of EU policy output from a positive perspective. This thesis wants to start filling this gap in the literature by studying the patterns of policy evolution in the European Union&rsquo;s research and technology development (RTD) policy. This policy is studied at three different levels of analysis. The first level is that of budgetary dynamics; here I test two alternative hypotheses on the pattern of budgetary change, both derived from the American literature: the classical incrementalist hypothesis, and the punctuated-equilibrium hypothesis of Bryan Jones and Frank Baumgartner. The second level of analysis is that of agenda dynamics, where I study the pattern of issue expansion/contraction on the fragmented agenda of the EU, and test two alternative hypotheses on the allocation of agenda space to RTD policy. The third level of analysis is that of institutional dynamics; here I test the hypothesis that institutional stability is associated with phases of incremental changes, whereas institutional developments occur in correspondence with budgetary punctuations. The empirical results show that both the budgetary and agenda dynamics of this policy are fully compatible with the punctuated-equilibrium hypothesis. However, the hypothesis on the correspondence between budgetary punctuations and institutional change is to be rejected. The final part of this work investigates the mechanism and the necessary conditions for the emergence of new policy priorities, by focusing on the recent emergence of security RTD as a new priority of the Framework Programme. This dissertation is the first work to empirically test the punctuated-equilibrium model on the EU, with an extensive and original dataset composed of budgetary, agenda and institutional delegation data."
"http://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/15419","Patterns of Transnationalization and Regulatory Change Beyond the EU: Explaining cross-sectoral variation in Ukraine","2010","LANGBEIN, Julia","Regulatory Reform -- European Union; Regulatory Reform -- Ukraine","This thesis seeks to explain cross-sectoral variation in convergence with EU rules in countries outside the EU that lack regulatory capacities and democratic development. In contrast to accounts predominant in the Europeanization literature, this study presents evidence to suggest that regulatory change in non-accession countries is not doomed to failure despite high initial adaptation costs that cannot be mitigated by EU membership conditionality. Making use of qualitative research methods, I analyze variation in convergence with EU rules in Ukraine across four policy sectors (corporate governance, technical regulation, telecommunications and food safety). I find that cross-sectoral variation is a function of different patterns of transnationalization that can be deep, shallow or mixed, depending on the properties and combined effects of interactions between domestic and external actors. In policy sectors where the combined effects of strong economic conditionality, strong market incentives for European and local firms and multiplex capacity building increase the incentives and capacities of domestic public and private actors for regulatory change, convergence with EU rules is likely to reach high levels thanks to deep patterns of transnationalization. My findings have the following implications. 1) Instead of high-powered political incentives (membership conditionality), the EU has down-to-earth economic incentives at its disposal (economic conditionality) to shape regulatory change in non-accession countries. Tying market access to convergence with EU rules in an unambiguous manner is necessary to achieve high levels of convergence beyond the EU&rsquo;s borders. 2) Analyzing the combined effects of conditionality, markets and capacity building is more fruitful for explaining cross-sectoral variation in convergence with EU rules than isolated analyses of each mechanism. 3) Convergence with EU rules is not just about creating another level of hierarchy in the markets and political systems of target countries. Rather, it is about creating institutions for governance arrangements in which public and private actors coordinate regulatory tasks. Hence, transnational interactions need to increase the incentives and capacities of public and private domestic actors for high levels of convergence. 4) In countries like Ukraine, Russia is not a countervailing hegemon that unfailingly seeks to obstruct convergence with EU rules. Rather, Russia should be conceived of as an adapative hegemon that promotes or obstructs convergence depending on the interests of Russian business."

The aim is to enhance our understanding of how national pension systems have evolved and how welfare states react to the challenges of population ageing and fiscal stress, a problem which I refer to as the pension dilemma. I take a combined look at policymaking and policy performance. On-the-ground outputs are assessed with a particular attention to redistribution across age groups and generations. The working hypothesis is that the burden of adjustment falls disproportionately on the young. While current and soon-to-be retirees have seen their pension rights largely unaffected, current labour market entrants will receive less in return for contributions paid, are more likely to experience career interruptions, and will, consequently, have more difficulties in obtaining full pension rights. Apart from being important in its own right, the hypothesis serves to tease out similarities and differences between countries. A look at demographic trends, the composition of social spending, and the socio-economic status of the aged across the OECD, reveals that diversity dominates among advanced welfare states. Studying the evolution of pension policy in three countries with Bismarckian pension systems, Italy, Germany and Sweden, we see, furthermore, that despite some similar policy responses, there is a surprising continued diversity with regard to how reforms are carried out and how these systems actually function. Advanced political economies have followed distinct paths in the past, and I submit that trajectories continue to be separate even though, on the face of it, reforms are in the process of making institutional architectures more alike. Going beyond the Bismarckian label, I characterise the Italian pension system as incoherent, the German as a classical and, finally, the Swedish as an egalitarian Bismarckian system. I submit that even in the context of significant reforms, they continue to be distinct from each other, and the dissertation offers an explanation of why we see a pattern of continued diversity. Most importantly, I submit that we need to situate the pension systems in their proper context taking account of their different socio-economic and institutional starting points. By studying the development of three modern pension systems over time, it becomes evident that previous policies form the most fundamental roadmap to new policies. Positive and negative policy feedbacks coexist. In some instances the cost of deviating from old principles renders certain policy options unfeasible (positive feedback). At other times they facilitate change through problems associated with old policy (negative feedback). Hence, actual policy output is more likely to be dictated by existing policies than exogenous shocks. If you begin with a more uniform and egalitarian system, the odds of reforming the system into a continued uniform and egalitarian system are rather good. By the same token, it is a difficult task to turn an incoherent and fragmented system into a coherent and uniform one. The effects of changes made to an incoherent system are much more difficult to predict. A classical system will be somewhere in-between these two extremes."
"http://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/13297","Pension Reforms in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe: Legislation, implementation and sustainability","2009","GUARDIANCICH, Igor","Old age pensions -- Europe, Central -- Finance; Old age pensions -- Europe, Eastern -- Finance; Old age pensions -- Europe, Southern -- Finance; Pensions -- European Union countries; Retirement -- Economic aspects -- Europe","The study analyses the legislation and implementation of pension reforms in four Central, Eastern and Southeastern European countries: Croatia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. By comparing the political economy of their policymaking processes, it pinpoints regularities between institutional settings, actor constellations, decision-making strategies and reform outcomes. The dissertation addresses three research questions: Why was reform possible and how was it carried through? What are its distributive consequences? Does it guarantee long-term political support? The main argument is that viable pension reforms should not be seen as an event, but rather as a continuing process that must be fiscally, socially and politically sustainable. The primary goals of a pension scheme are poverty reduction, consumption smoothing and insurance. These can be achieved only if the scheme enjoys continuing political support at all levels. Elaborating on this premise, the research makes four broad claims; two related to legislation and two to the implementation of reforms. First, policymakers in post-socialist countries quickly exhausted the possibility of enacting simple corrective measures and were hence forced to negotiate pension reforms with the pro-welfare coalition. Complex exchanges between policy and politics became central to these negotiated bargains. Second, systemic reforms introducing policy innovations, such as funding, were politically superior to parametric changes. Systemic innovations are a source of popular support and free room for manoeuvre. The new funded elements are traded for cuts in public pension schemes. Third, trade-offs between fiscal and social sustainability emerged during legislation, jeopardizing successful implementation. Excessive emphasis on financial viability conflicts with sound social policy. Conversely, failure to eliminate extreme imbalances between contributions and benefits, and unjustified special privileges disrupt the fiscal budget. Finally, how legislation is conducted is important for a reform&rsquo;s political acceptability. Negotiated bargains are qualitatively different from other modes of policymaking. Contrary to a received wisdom in the literature, the thesis argues that inclusive decision-making, as opposed to limited bargaining, increases both the effectiveness of reforms and their political sustainability over time. The involvement of a greater number of stakeholders allows for smoother implementation: costly deviations from efficient solutions are avoided, and incentives to stick to the reform&rsquo;s initial rationale are put in place. With respect to existing work, this study makes two innovations. First, it extends analysis to ten years of implementation, following the reform wave of the late 1990s. Second, it employs theoretical instruments to study Eastern pension reforms that are entirely consistent with those applied to the West. The dissertation links the legislative and the implementation phases together by adapting the Natali-Rhodes&rsquo; theoretical framework, developed for pension reforms in Continental Europe. The &lsquo;spillover&rsquo; is justified on multiple grounds. First, sufficient analogies exist between the institutional structure and the mounting problems of Bismarckian retirement arrangements and post-socialist pension schemes. Second, this approach accounts for the popularity of systemic pension reforms in the region. By focussing on the &lsquo;creative opportunism&rsquo; of policymakers, it shows how they simultaneously introduced policy improvements and imposed benefit cuts. Finally, the framework is easily extended to the implementation of reforms, thereby linking individual decision-makers&rsquo; preferences to policy outcomes and their consequent sustainability in time."

University students in the age category of 18-26 years old from three countries that differ in their levels of media literacy context - Austria, Italy, and the Netherlands - were the target group of participants in this experimental/quasi-experimental research (N = 736). After measuring their media habits and attitudes as well as levels of political competence, they were randomly assigned to read one of two simulated Internet news reports - either a manipulated or a non-manipulated one. Each version of the news reports was presented as being taken either from a popular 'traditional' or an 'alternative' Internet news source in each country; however, the content of both was absolutely identical. The participants then evaluated the news report they had read according to a set of characteristics. Analysis revealed that political competence appeared to have no effects at all on spotting and rejecting. Moreover, a comparison of three age categories in the Italian sample (18-26, 27-35 and 36= years old; N = 394) showed that age was not a moderator of the effects of political competence on a critical evaluation of manipulated news. However, participants from countries ranked with a higher media literacy context were more likely to spot manipulation in the Internet news reports and reject the promoted standpoint(s). In addition, a puzzling relationship was discovered between spotting and rejecting, as not everyone who spotted manipulation subsequently rejected the manipulated standpoint, but accepted it instead. Also, it transpired that, depending on the country, a certain subtype of manipulated news report - from either 'traditional' or 'alternative' Internet news sources - was regarded by participants of that country as more persuasive and trustworthy. On the whole, the findings of the thesis revealed some important aspects of the relationships between individual skills of critical assessment of news media information and a susceptibility to manipulation effects, on the one side, and political competence and media literacy context, on the other, which collectively contribute to creating a framework for further research in the area."

Bottici demonstrates that myth is a process, one of continuous work on a basic narrative pattern that responds to a need for significance. Human beings need meaning in order to master the world they live in, but they also need significance in order to live in a world that is less indifferent to them. This is particularly true in the realm of politics. Political myths are narratives through which we orient ourselves, and act and feel about our political world. Bottici shows that in order to come to terms with contemporary phenomena, such as the clash between civilizations, we need a Copernican revolution in political philosophy.

Furthermore, I sketch an alternative solution to the challenge which this theory confronts. The main challenge in the political liberalism of Rawls and Larmore is the difficult reconciliation between, on the one hand, the value of justice seen as the ultimate and substantive standard for the assessment of institutions and policies and, on the other hand, the pervasive pluralism of ideas of the good life and their supporting world views, in contemporary liberal societies. Political liberalism reconciles these by considering that principles of justice can be consensual in a pluralist society because they are political, not comprehensive (according to Rawls) or neutral in their justifications (according to Larmore). In this way, contentious moralities and philosophies, whether religious or not, are precluded from political justification. &#13;"

Despite its centrality to state power, the police have never become a mainstream subject of political sociology. Particularly on a stage where governments perform state power in the face of societal dissent, the police are not bit players but lead actors who demystify curiously about the political foundations of a regime. My dissertation focuses on contemporary manifestations of protest policing in a geography where democratization incorporated previously discredited actors into the political centre while the strong hand of the state advanced in modern technologies of law enforcement. I specifically interrogate how the transformation of the police after 1980 and more precisely since the end of the 1990s reflects on the policing of public protests, and how this transformation resonates with the patterns of protest in the country. I am also empirically interested in the application of this process on contentious gatherings of different origin; namely on labour, student, and pro-Kurdish protests. Throughout the thesis, I argue that the empowerment of the police in Turkey translated into the interactive dynamics with protester groups. While the police's differential strategies resonate with divergent protest strategies, the political fabrication of ""threats"" is a means to justify police empowerment through increased para-militarization and legal instruments. In order to address my research question, I resort to methodological pluralism, and use multiple sources. The descriptively quantitative data on the protest events provide me with preliminary yet illustrative information, which I substantiate with the analysis of official and unofficial documents, semi-structured interviews, archival and visual material in qualitative fashion. I further benefit from secondary literature to yield a comparative knowledge on the subject."

Why, in other words, do policy makers in some countries innovate faster than in others? This thesis challenges conventional explanations, according to which policy change occurs in response to class conflict, partisan preferences, power of professional groups, or institutional and policy legacies. The thesis instead argues that different paths of policy change can be best explained by the different learning processes by which policy makers develop ideas for new policies in reaction to old policies. The thesis draws upon both ideational and institutional streams of literature on policy change, and develops its argument that policy change, understood as a learning process, is a result of interactions between three different, yet interdependent factors &ndash; ideas, interests and institutions. The thesis explores this argument by investigating in detail two radical cases of policy innovation &ndash; the introduction of market-oriented elements in Czech and Polish healthcare policy during the first two post-communist decades. The selection of the two cases is based on the methodological rationale of the 'most similar system design', given that the healthcare systems of the two countries were both state-dominated under communism, while in the post-communist period the governments of the two countries introduced market-oriented reforms that followed rather divergent policy paths. While Czech reforms were relatively consistent and comprehensive, those in Poland were fragmented, delayed and beset with reversals. The thesis looks at these two cases of healthcare reforms from a long-term historical perspective, covering the inter-war, the communist and, most thoroughly, the post-communist period. It draws upon the official documents, secondary literature and more than 40 interviews with policy making elites, and compares the two policy paths using small-N research design, causal analysis and process tracing techniques. The main finding of the thesis is that the market-oriented ideas that occurred in healthcare policy circles during the 1970s and 1980s were crucial drivers of the post-communist reforms in the two countries. However, the capacity of these ideas to serve as a basis of policy change was dependent on two factors &ndash; on the existence of political actors who were willing to promote these ideas, and on the interaction of institutional veto points with the electoral and partisan dynamic. The findings of this thesis contribute to the better integration of the literatures on the role of ideational and institutional factors in policy change, and to the research on the causes and consequences of marketization in healthcare and, more broadly, in social policy."
"http://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/10466","A Political Bond in Europe","2007","WHITE, Jonathan","Europe -- Politics and government -- 1989-; Democracy -- Europe","This thesis explores a new way to conceptualise political community in the contemporary European context. Its point of departure is the normative debate concerning the type of collective bond feasible and desirable as an underpinning for the European Union, a debate centred on the older political-philosophical question of what must be common to a set of people such that they may be ruled through the same institutions. The thesis argues that many of the existing approaches, which conceive a bond in terms of shared interests, cultural attributes, values, or practices of trust and solidarity, are liable either to underplay or to overplay how much the citizens of a polity must have in common, tending either to empty public life of the pursuit of shared ends or conversely to downgrade the importance of adversarialism. Both may be seen as depoliticising moves. Instead, drawing on agonistic theories of democracy and certain strands of political sociology, a more explicitly political conception of the collective bond is explored, based on the appraisal of substantive problems. Political community, it is suggested, should be sought in the common-sense assumptions and taken-for-granted reference-points people invoke when discussing matters of political relevance. The concept of a &lsquo;political bond&rsquo;, whereby members of the collective are tied by a sense of shared predicament before common problems, is proposed as a normative ideal. This raises questions for empirical study to do with what problems people hold to exist, whom these are assumed to affect, and what possibilities of collective action are recognised for their address. These issues are explored in depth using group discussions with taxidrivers in Britain, Germany and the Czech Republic. Under scrutiny is the extent to which commonplace ways of speaking about the political serve to strengthen a European political bond, and in what respects they run counter to it and would need challenging if a European polity were to have everyday resonance. The analysis indicates that while substantive problems of common concern are readily and richly articulated, and many of them placed in a transnational context, there is notable scepticism about the possibility of their remedy, and unevenness in the degree to which opponents are positioned as legitimate. The thesis argues that only by tackling these wider patterns, which link to the health of contemporary democracy more generally, is it likely to prove possible to build a desirable political community at the European level."

This dissertation studies the effect of financial risk on policy and party preferences. I analyze three different types of financial risk: student debt, mortgages, and private pension savings. They are the result of the three most important financial investments of households. I examine their effect on attitudes towards taxation, labor market, monetary, and social policies, as well as party support, and vote choice in the 2000s. This decade witnessed both a boom and bust of financial markets. All financial investments have in common that they first lower income, but promise higher income in the future. They are also substitutes for social insurance and other social benefits. Following the median voter theorem, there should be a shift to policies and parties on the right of the political spectrum when income increases. At the same time, individuals are exposed to financial risks: What happens if the investment does not pay off? Therefore, individuals will demand policies that both protect the returns of their investment as well as shelter them from risk. I argue that there are four effects: the income effect, the insurance effect, the risk effect, and the crisis effect. The income effect leads to a dislike for higher taxation. The insurance effect reduces demand for redistribution. The risk effect leads to different demands for different targeted policies, and the crisis effect reinforces both the income and risk effect. Analyzing panel and survey data from the United Kingdom and United States, as well as a comparative data, I show that savers are united and borrowers divided. I find that financial market risk, unlike labor market risk and contrary to what we would expect from the literature on the effect of globalization in individual attitudes towards the state, moves individuals further to the right. The crisis reinforced this effect. This dissertation speaks to previous research in welfare state retrenchment, new social risks, and inequality in post-industrial economies. It sheds light on the question of why we have not seen a new powerful group fighting for redistribution in the wake of the last crisis."

And why do developing countries give different accounts of state institution-building? This study argues that state economic institution-building is a function of the ruling incumbents&rsquo; motives and scope conditions. Motives refer to the incumbents&rsquo; identification of state institutionbuilding with their immediate and direct interest of political survival in office. Meanwhile, scope conditions refer to the enabling or constraining factors that the incumbents confront in pursuit of reform which either supplement or limit their autonomy and resources. The study examines the cases of Turkey and Egypt following the embarking on economic liberalization in 1980 and 1990 respectively. On the one hand, Turkey witnessed considerable institution-building in export-related policy and regulation areas with remarkable implications for export expansion and restructuring from raw materials into manufactured products. Conversely, postliberalization Egypt suffered from institutional stagnation associated with a poor export performance and persistent dependency on oil exports. The claim is that Turkish incumbents have been more motivated and enabled to undertake encompassing institutional reforms with the aim of export expansion restricting than their Egyptian counterparts."

Since the Union has always been considered as an economic giant and a political dwarf at the global level, the objective is to evaluate whether the EU external trade may be considered as a useful tool to address the gap between its economic and political relevance. If the EU is effectively able to wiled a political influence through trade also beyond the neighbourhood area, where it uses the membership card chip, the EU might have a greater global role. The conceptual analysis of the Thesis is based on the distinction between the EU trade Power (i.e. Resources, Institutions and Values), EU trade Policy activity and its final Influence in order to disentangle the 'levers' from the 'leverage' exercised by the EU through its external trade policy. The potential for political influence of the EU ultimately relies on the ability to change the norms, beliefs, rules and regulations in EU partner countries, during and after the trade negotiations. The empirical side of the research focuses on two bilateral agreements: the EU-Mexico Partnership Agreement (2000), and the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the EU and South Korea (2009). Despite the strong differences between the case studies (in terms of their geographic location, production and export patterns, timing of the negotiations, etc.), Mexico and South Korea share four basic similarities: i) neither is an EU neighbouring country (i.e. the EU cannot use the membership card); ii) both are strongly dependant and receive their primary influence in economic, political and security terms from the United States; iii) both have strongly endorsed neoliberal and free market principles; and finally iv) each of them might be a potential gateway for the EU in its macro-region. Furthermore, Mexico and South Korea share also a more specific strategic value for the EU in three main respects. First, in both cases the rationale for EU to conclude the agreements was the same: economic and defensive vis-&agrave;-vis US previous trade agreements (the NAFTA and the US-South-Korea FTA). Second, the basic objectives of the EU in both countries tend to correspond to a great extent: the achievement of the commercial parity treatment of EU for its exporters vis-&agrave;-vis US&rsquo; exporters. Third, the overall political influence of the EU in the countries might thus be not only limited, but also fairly comparable. The theoretical structure and the empirical work highlight interesting indications. First, in terms of Power, neither the EU trade power, nor the conclusion of trade agreements is sufficient for the EU to exert, by default, a political influence in the countries considered. Second, in terms of Policy, during Peter Mandelson&rsquo;s tenure as EC Trade Commissioner, the Union downsized the normative and political ambition of its external trade action in respect to the past, focusing on the achievement of commercial-parity objectives vis-&agrave;-vis other major global actors (i.e. a defensive trade strategy in relation to that of the US). Finally, in terms of Influence, both cases indicate that the EU has still a limited capacity to exert a political influence via its trade policy in nonneighbouring countries. Four main reasons help to explain this: 1) Internal institutional constraints within the EU; 2) The bilateral level of trade negotiation; 3) The weakness of EU&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy and of its Common Security and Defence Policy; 4) The defensive rather than proactive global projection of the EU. The Thesis concludes that although the EU foreign economic policy can be a means to address the capability-expectations gap that affects the EU as an international actor, there is still ample scope to improve the EU political influence through trade in countries beyond the neighbourhood area in economic, political and/or normative terms."

The latter affects broadcaster independence by creating more standardized and professionalized news, which in turn reduces politicians&rsquo; incentives to intervene in the broadcaster. The former affects broadcaster independence by making it less likely that such intervention will be effective. I demonstrate these claims in two ways. First, I conduct a large-N statistical analysis of 36 public service broadcasters (PSBs), in which I demonstrate that legal protection news market size are statistically significant predictors of PSB independence (as I operationalize it), and that other suggested explanatory factors &mdash; party system polarization and bureaucratic partisanship &mdash; have no effect. Second, I carry out a comparative historical analysis of six European PSBs&mdash;Radiotelevisione Italiana, Radiotelevisi&oacute;n Espa&ntilde;ola, Radio Telef&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann (Ireland), the British Broadcasting Corporation, Danmarks Radio, and Sveriges Radio and its associated companies (Sweden) &mdash; and substantiate the claims made in my statistical analysis. In particular, I demonstrate that where the market for news was bigger, broadcasters capitalised on pre-existing journalistic experience, adopting the house-styles of press agencies and learning from journalists&rsquo; associations. Conversely, where the market was small, that experience could not be drawn on, and broadcast journalism attracted political intervention."

Building on neo-institutional theories of party change and adaptation, and especially on historical and sociological institutionalism, this thesis offers an alternative set of explanations for the organizational forms of the Europarties. In so doing, it brings into question both the extent of their organizational convergence and the primary focus of the literature on environmental factors, as well the limits of the few comparisons between Euroand national level party organizations that have been made thus far. To this end, the research focuses on the organization of the two largest Europarties - the European People&rsquo;s Party (EPP) and the Party of European Socialists (PES) - and on how and why they differ from one another. Europarty organizational development is explained through an assessment of the impact of the organizational traditions of the individual member parties on their EU-level counterpart. Building on data gathered through in-depth interviews, archival research, and personal observations of party proceedings, as well as on the analysis of the formal documents, this thesis delineates and compares the organization and institutional rules of the EPP and the PES over the more than 30-year life-span of their existence, both at the formal and informal level. It also presents a thorough account of the EU legal framework providing for direct financing of Europarties and assesses its impact on their organization and activities. This thesis demonstrates the existence of important organizational differences between the EPP and the PES relating, among other elements, to their structure, the design of their decision-making process, membership policy and how party goals are specified. This claim stems also from the argument that organizational differences between EPP and PES member parties are transmitted to the EU level, thus causing a similar variation between the EPP and the PES themselves. Therefore, choices made by politicians on the EU transnational party scene are influenced by the ways in which they think about national party politics, despite the very different institutional environment of EU politics. In this way, the more we study the Europarties, the more we learn about national political parties. It is also apparent that these organizational choices have been relatively constant since the beginning of the EPP and the PES. Path dependency and historical institutionalism therefore prove to be especially powerful explanatory frameworks. In sum, the thesis has confirmed early assumptions that we need to look more deeply into organization of Europarties in order to gain more insight into their overall nature and role"

Looking at Italy and Germany in particular, it tells a story that is fairly common to retirement systems across the OECD. Over the last forty years, pension institutions have been facing major economic and demographic challenges. This 'affordability crisis' has slowly eroded the confidence of large segments of the population in the old pension contract, while paving the way for the anti-welfare rhetoric and initiatives of more than a conservative policy entrepreneur. Cost containment reforms took root and clamped down on pension spending and, what is more, on public responsibility for individual welfare after quiescence. As a result, pension income is lower and riskier now than was expected when today's pensioners entered the labour market. Most notably, it will be even more meagre and uncertain for tomorrow's retirees. By comparing the Italian and German reform patterns, this thesis suggests that answering the puzzle requires focusing on two sets of interrelated transformations: the prominence of so-called 'systemic risks' and the changing ways of political representation. Risks hereby defined as 'systemic'first emerged in Western political economies in the 1970s, only to turn into a recurring malaise during the following decades (Streeck 2011). Unlike the risks central to the post-war welfare state model, they far outreach the individual level, being borne by the community or by society as a whole. Furthermore, those risks proved somehow resilient to traditional means of public intervention and management. Systemic risks, in sum, have originated a distinctive combination of functional and political effects, ultimately providing a functional as well as a political rationale to risk shifting reforms. Again, since the 1970s political representation has also changed. On the one side, the traditional mass party model has been replaced by new organisational forms, while new parties and party families have emerged, activating novel issues and cleavages. On the other side, industrial representation in the corporate arena changed as well, becoming less organised all over the industrialised world. Systemic risks, then, have further influenced transformations in both the electoral and the corporate arenas, further eroding the political consensus for expanding social responsibility and socialising risks. It was, in other words, the co-evolution of problems and politics (to put it in Kingdon's terms) to lead popular and strongly institutionalised pension systems to challenge the basic tenets of their pension promises, although this common story played out very differently across different countries as a result of the action of national institutional filters (policy legacies and the functioning of the electoral and corporate arenas)."

By identifying the political milieu of the policy, it seeks to problematise the established depiction of ESDP and delineate the framing involved in designing and implementing the policy. I thus advance the argument about the all-pervading character of the political and I stipulate the value of micropolitical analysis for unpacking broad political arrangements. In order to trace security practices enacted through the policy, I explore in depth two instances of ESDP operations and a case of strengthening the UNIFIL forces to Lebanon via an EU initiative. I conclude that the ESDP has proven transformative both within the EU internal system of governance and vis-&agrave;-vis the EU&rsquo;s international positioning. The former involves the rise of domestic politics engendered by the interplay of institutional identities and conceptions of achieving EU security. The latter exposes the shift in the international role assignments wherein the EU becomes a deputy of the US and a saviour of the UN&rsquo;s reputation."

Banks enjoy a public safety net. Governments, however, can make banks pay for this protection. Two of this dissertation&rsquo;s conclusions stand out. The first is that the influence of business through lobbying and other channels of instrumental power is exaggerated. Banks cannot secure sweetheart deals by pointing to their track record of campaign contributions. Bailouts are not for sale. During crises, governments can use banks&rsquo; dependence on the domestic market to force them to bear the bailout costs. Only highly international banks, can parry this threat by using their structural power strategically. The second conclusion is that financial crises remove veto points. They create a large threat and leave little time for deliberation, which prompts lawmakers defer to the executive branch. Thus, financial crises shift power from legislatures&mdash;even strong ones, like the US Congress&mdash;to the head of government."

The aim of the thesis is to provide a convincing theoretical argument able to identify what are the policy problems that demand lawmakers' attention, but also to test this empirically for France, Denmark, Spain and the United Kingdom between 1980 and 2008. This research shows how accounting for the way in which lawmakers deal with competing policy problems integrate two major accounts of the way in which governments set their priorities: party mandate approaches and public policy approaches. The thesis does so by suggesting that given their double role of representatives and administrators, lawmakers have to deliver policies consistent both with electoral and non-electoral mandates. In this framework, parties&rsquo; promises, administrative commitments, and the priorities of the public originate policy problems that compete for lawmakers' attention to enter the policy agenda. Compared to classic party mandate approaches, this research does not conceive parties as being the key actors of the game or the major agenda-setters. Compared to public policy approaches, the study does not dismiss the role of parties. The theory argues that a problem-solving approach is key to account for lawmakers' priorities and for the way in which lawmakers select policy problems that need to be addressed in the policy agenda. In this framework, different policy problems demand lawmakers' attention and problems-solving scholars have illustrated that the types of issues that need to be addressed are different in ""nature"". Existing accounts of the composition of policy agendas distinguish between problems ranging from ""compulsory"" to ""discretionary"" concerns (Walker 1977; Adler and Wilkerson 2012) where the former derive from ""periodically recurring demands "" and the latter from ""chosen problems"" (Walker 1977:425). Building on these contributions, the theoretical model of the dissertation discusses the ""nature"" of different policy problems by identifying some 'ideal types' that originate from the double functions that lawmakers shall perform in contemporary democracies as ""representatives"" of voters' interests and as ""responsible"" administrators (Mair 2009). In this sense, the dissertation contends that different policy problems emerge from the electoral promises of the governing parties, from commitments related to the responsibility of being in office, and from the 'external world', and that the balance between them determines the composition of the policy agenda. 13 There are four propositions of this study to existing knowledge in the field of policy agendas. The first is that the content of the policy agenda is stable across countries with different institutional settings. Lawmakers' priorities are no less stable in institutional systems that are more 'open' to accommodating policy problems brought by the electoral promises of the parties. At the same time stability persists even when elections approach, questioning the long-lasting assumption that lawmakers may manipulate policies to their will in order to assure re-election. The second is that policy problems brought by the electoral promises of the governing parties impact lawmakers&rsquo; priorities, but this is only half of an old story. The results show that the policy problems originating from the electoral promises of the opposition influence the content of the policy agenda confirming that the agenda-setting power of parties is not limited to those who are in office. The third proposition is a theoretical effort and empirical contribution to conceptualise and measure ""policy commitments"". Studies of public policy have stressed the importance of inherited commitments in everyday law making (Rose 1994; Adler and Wilkerson 2012) since some decisions take longer than a legislature to be realised. Classic analyses have emphasised the importance of budgetary constraints on policy agendas, but the thesis suggests that there is also another striking case of policy commitments for European polities: EU integration, since decisions on EU affairs and delegation of powers taken from previous governments are hard (if not impossible) to reverse by their successors. In this sense, EU decisions are inherited by all governments, and they add complexity to the problem-solving capacity of Member States because they produce extra policy problems that require lawmakers' attention. For lawmakers respecting legally binding EU decisions, this is a way to avoid ""reckless and illegal decision making"" (Mair 2009). The results highlight that when reflecting on the divisions of competences between the Union and its Member States (MSs), policy commitments derived from the EU directives are concentrated on a narrow set of policy areas. The results show that in most fields where commitments are higher, the agenda-setting power of parties&rsquo; electoral promises is weakened. Finally, this research suggests that policy problems originating from the agenda of the public (as approximated by media coverage) are another explanatory factor of policy priorities, but in a very narrow set of policy areas. Media effects appear to be limited to policy areas with the special characteristics of newsworthiness and sensationalism (Soroka 2002) that contribute to boost their policy appeal. In addition, the findings highlight that the agenda-setting power of the media is mediated by the interaction with the electoral promises of the opposition, probably as a result of a blame avoidance game to discredit incumbents. 14 Chapter 1 introduces the concepts of policy agenda and policy problem before summarising existing accounts of the content of policy agendas. Two theoretical traditions are identified. The first one is the ""partisan account"" highlighting the importance of partisan preferences for lawmakers' priorities. The second is made up of the ""public policy accounts"" proposing incrementalist and agenda-setting approaches to representatives' priorities. Chapter 2 sets up the theoretical framework that will be tested in this research. Drawing upon theories of ""representative and responsible"" government (Mair 2009) the research provides an encompassing model of how different policy problems compete for attention in order to enter the agendas of lawmakers. The thesis highlights that different agenda-setters have to be considered as creating policy problems: the electoral promises of the governing parties, the demands addressed to lawmakers by the EU agenda, and the issues that are important for the public as reported by the media. Starting from existing typologies of problems that must be addressed in the policy agenda (Walker 1977; Adler and Wilkerson 2012), the research roughly distinguishes between discretionary and compulsory policy problems, discussing how the three agenda-setters considered in this study fit into those ideal types, as well as the incentives for lawmakers to prioritise one over the other. Chapter 3 presents the data, models and methods that are used to test the theoretical framework. The dissertation relies on data from the Comparative Agendas Project modelled in the form of time series cross sectional models. Chapter 4 introduces the empirical investigation of the content of the policy agenda. It focuses on stability and change in lawmakers' priorities, to understand the extent to which priorities change (or remain the same) across elections. Chapter 5 moves a step further and will assess the connection between policy problems brought by parties' electoral promises and the content of the policy agenda. Chapter 6 will account for one of the most debated sources of policy problems among public policy scholars: policy commitments. This chapter will test the agenda-setting power of policy commitments deriving from the content of the EU directives on lawmakers' priorities and proposing an ""EU acquiescence index"" to shed light on the 'overlaps' between EU and domestic policy agendas. Finally, Chapter 7 aims at analysing the connection between lawmakers' priorities and media coverage (in terms of print and, where appropriate, audio media) and each of the two relevant types of policy problems competing for lawmakers' attention identified in the previous chapters. In sum the thesis offers a theory of the composition of policy agendas grounded in a problem-solving understanding of politics, and an empirical assessment of its validity. In this sense the study is about how policy problems originating from the dual role of lawmakers in 15 contemporary democracies (representation and administration) affect everyday policy making. More precisely the thesis considers the impact of different agenda venues (parties, EU commitments, and the media) on the way in which lawmakers deliver policies."

This could simply be due to the fact that Southern researchers were too occupied with their own countries' regional problems and party systems. This problem was initially raised by Klandermans and Tarrow (1988: 16-7) as a challenging point to one of the most basic assumptions of the European Tradition of &laquo;New&raquo; Social Movement Studies, which stresses a causal link between advanced industrialism and &laquo;new&raquo; social movements."

In studies of immigrant integration, however, most analyses have assumed that each state pursues a single and coherent national approach. The aim of this dissertation is to challenge this assumption by examining how states pursue integration differently for different categories of migrants in post-enlargement Europe. In addition to third country nationals I consider also migrants who have a special cultural and historical bond with their host countries, such as emigrants and descendants of emigrants or migrants from the former colonies (co-ethnics), as well as European Union citizens from old and new member states. The dissertation builds on empirical evidence collected from 1985 to 2012 at national, regional and city levels in two new countries of immigration in Western Europe: Italy and Spain. The first main finding is that both Italy and Spain chose to distance themselves from the integration policies of the more traditional countries of immigration in Europe, which they classify as failures. Instead, the new immigration countries searched for their ""own"" integration strategy, which they consider a token of sovereignty just as much as immigration control. Secondly, both states have introduced different integration policies and integration requirements for different categories of migrants. Rather than pursuing only one integration strategy, the states examined use their resources and abilities to simultaneously pursue different integration strategies for European citizens, co-ethnics and third country nationals. These strategies range from less to more restrictive (from laissez-faire to mandatory, sanction-based policies, such as the Italian integration agreement and language test). European Union citizens enjoy many rights in when residing in other member states without being included in their integration programmes, while third country nationals enjoy far fewer rights which they risk to lose if they do not comply with demanding integration programmes. Co-ethnics in turn are included in integration programmes but have more rights than other third country nationals and, in some areas such as access to citizenship and enrolment in the army, they have even more rights than European citizens. Finally, this dissertation finds a negative correlation between immigrants' social class in the host society and their rights and integration requirements: the lower the socio-economic position of the immigrant group, the fewer its rights and the more demanding the integration requirements it faces."

As a main novelty, the research intends to go beyond judicial behaviour models that focus predominantly on explaining the use of preliminary references. One could namely suggest that the way national courts participate in the preliminary reference procedure is not sufficient to assess the available modes for the judicial integration of Europe. Accordingly, the study considers the impact of political institutional and attitudinal factors affecting the judicial enforcement of EU law. This is done by posing new questions, for instance, the relevance of national judges&rsquo; preferences towards EU legal order and institutions, as well as by evaluating and reviewing the impact of political and legal institutions on their behaviour and its consequences for policy areas. First of all, the analysis confirms the influence of judges&rsquo; evaluation of EU institutions and their national counterparts on their self-perception as EU judges and, subsequently, in the application of EU law. Secondly, the study shows how national institutions, like governments and national high courts, play a prominent role in shaping national courts&rsquo; incentives for the application of EU law, as they may use their institutional power to circumvent judges&rsquo; decisions. Finally, it reviews the strategic use of European instruments such as the CJEU precedent and its doctrines (e.g. supremacy) to overcome domestic threats when applying EU law. To conclude, the study tries to expand the explanatory power of the middle range accounts of the role national courts played, by integrating the analytical strength of the legalist/ intergovernmentalist theories into neo-functionalism."

While examples are legion-reaching from legislative drafting in national ministries to the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) in the European Union (EU)- the project focuses on preparation in complex international negotiations, and chooses EU Intergovernmental Conferences (IGCs) as empirical case. Claiming that a look beyond the tip of the ""decision-iceberg"" will gain us deeper insights into how and by whom Europe has been constitutionalised, I tackle two wider questions: 1) What is preparation and what can it do? and 2) Under what conditions will preparation be effective? Linked to an understanding of international negotiation as a ""thick"" social process, I argue, first, that the key to preparatory effectiveness lies in a particular set of collective resources as a necessary condition, and in consensual preagreement as both necessary and sufficient. Second, with effective pre-decision-making thus hinging upon successful delegated arguing, a set of scope conditions favourable to persuasion are singled out. These include 1) a familiar, iterative and insulated social context as a pre-condition for the non-distortive use of arguments; 2) an issue's complexity as facilitating the resonance of expertise and novel ideas; and 3) a macronorm's constitutional-systemic nature as favouring factual arguments linked to the international system. The hypotheses are tested on the ""Group of Government Representatives"" (GoR), with units of observation chosen from the Amsterdam and Nice IGCs according to variation of issue complexity and constitutional-systemic nature. Process-tracing of five issues: the communitarisation of free movement, the integration of Schengen and the institutionalisation of flexibility (Amsterdam), as well as Commission reform and Council votes (Nice) confirms that delegated preparation plays a key role even in the ""bastion of high politics"" that is EU reform. Yet, empirical evidence shows that persuasion is less prominent than expected, and uncovers alternative mechanisms behind effective preparation,in particular accommodation, depoliticisation and systemic compensation."

Despite their similarities, these parties' experiences of coalition have been diverse. This thesis seeks to explain variation among these cases in respect of three outcomes: Green parties' attainment of senior ministerial positions at the moment of government formation  their retention of cabinet office over time  and their electoral outcomes at the end of their spell in coalition. It finds that environmental factors were consistently important for producing these outcomes, but that under many conditions, variation in Green parties' attributes and strategies also played a role. To explain variation in office attainment outcomes, the thesis makes use of an explicitly conjunctural theory that has been developed in the study of support parties. The set of causal factors identified by this theory provides a basis for identifying pathways to high and low office attainment outcomes that are that are empirically consistent and theoretically coherent. In studying office retention outcomes, it develops a framework based on parties' incentives to maximise their electoral and governmental outcomes within a dynamic and institutionally variable setting. It provides a first explanatory account of variation in parties' tenure, identifying a number of pathways to the end of a party's time in office. Finally, the thesis builds on the literature on postincumbency electoral outcomes to identify several paths to post-coalition electoral success and failure. In particular, it suggests that the relatively 'soft' electoral base of Green parties in coalition is an important factor in their losses and that defection from coalition can be electorally beneficial only under restrictive conditions. It identifies a strong tension between office-seeking success and electoral success that presents these parties with especially 'hard choices'."

This broad research problem is translated into a number of specific questions: how can we characterize the particularities of the Polish case? What is the relationship between populism and democracy in Poland? Can the growing strength of the populists be seen as a sign of a serious crisis of Polish democracy or does it simply reflect something that might be defined as populist democracy? This thesis attempts to answer these research questions through case studies of selected politicians (Lech Walesa and Stanislaw Tyminski), parties (Self-Defence, League of Polish Families and Law and Justice) and a movement (Radio Maryja). The cases chosen meet two conditions: they were identified as populist in the public discourse and they played a major role in Polish political life. The empirical part of the research was based on qualitative analysis of primary party literature, interviews, secondary literature and a limited use of questionnaires. The thesis confirms that populism can be identified in all the cases studied. At the same time the thesis shows that the form of populism varies between populism as a strategy and populism as an ideology (thin-centred ideology or ideology in a strict sense). Irrespective of its form, the main tool of populism is its discourse. The thesis also distinguishes three waves of populism: two in opposition (1989-2005) followed by a third wave in power (2005-2007). Each wave had its own characteristic features ranging from social, anti-EU to anti-liberal elements. In all cases populism was an expression of conservative and Christian values, which seem to be a specific Polish feature. Yet another important element in the Polish case is the anti-establishment emphasis, an emphasis that derives from dissatisfaction with the settlement of accounts with communism. From this emerges the concept of a &lsquo;network&rsquo;, a categorization linking post-communist bureaucrats and compromised opposition forces. The thesis concludes that populists in Poland were not opposed to democracy as such, but rather to constitutionalism and procedural democracy. Populism was, above all, a warning sign of social tensions in liberal democracy. Polish populists opposed populist democracy to its liberal version. The case of Poland has also demonstrated the ways in which democracy can resist populism."

Considering the trajectories of individual states between 1990 &ndash; 2007, this dissertation challenges two central bodies of theory relating to democratization and regime change. Through a sustained analysis of global and post-communist developments within this time period, the author shows that claims of an increasing asymmetry between the &lsquo;electoral&rsquo; and &lsquo;liberal&rsquo; elements of modern democracy have been greatly exaggerated. The author goes on to contend that in accounting for the geographical dispersion of post-communist regime forms, deeper structural factors should be considered as crucial. The dissertation is divided into the following parts: * Part I demonstrates how different conceptualisations of democracy can lead to very different conclusions about the empirical dynamics of democratization. * Part II contrasts different explanations of post-communist political change and provides an integrated framework for explaining the political pathways encountered within the former Eastern Bloc. This dissertation will be of interest to students and scholars of post-communist studies, democratization studies, comparative politics and regime change."

Therefore, in this thesis I study how official national imaginaries have been promoted through iconographic and written messages in postage stamps; how such messages are linked to the ideology, interests and goals of political elites; and how competing elites and groups with relative power within the state try to influence such official ideas about the nation. The thesis is divided in three sections. The first presents a theoretical framework for the study of national imaginaries. It also presents the properties of stamps that made them ideal 'carriers&rsquo; of ideological propaganda. The second section analyses a random sample of 1,000 stamps by means of a typology of ideological messages. It was found that the vast majority of stamps are carrying messages related to the features, composition, and historical development of the nation that issued the stamp. Then, these 'nationalist&rsquo; stamps were further studied by means of a second typology, in order to differentiate the particular aspects of the nation that were promoted in each stamp. The third section analyses the political goals and processes behind nationalist messages in stamps. For that, both the United Kingdom during 1950-1970 and post-revolutionary Mexico were studied using process-tracing methodology. It was found that, while the most important actors are still the ruling elites, other actors such as competing elites, local authorities, pressure groups or social organizations will also try to influence the messages about the nation in stamps. A relevant finding is that intermediate structures, such as middle-range public officers in postal institutions, can have a key role not only in the promotion, but also in the shaping of official national imaginaries."
"http://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/20714","Post-Transitional Justice? Spain, Poland and Portugal compared","2012","RAIMUNDO, Filipa",NA,"This dissertation elaborates on a new concept &ndash; post-transitional justice &ndash; to define the re-emergence of the issues of the authoritarian past onto the political agenda after democratic consolidation. The thesis sets out to understand the reasons why the past is coming back in certain consolidated democracies and not in others. It argues that in order to understand why these issues return to the agenda it is necessary to analyze them in light of the politico-institutional characteristics of each post-authoritarian democracy. The results suggest that &lsquo;political willingness&rsquo; and &lsquo;institutional capacity&rsquo;, as they have been theorized in this research, are two strong factors that help explain the link between the &lsquo;politics of the past&rsquo; and the &lsquo;politics of the present&rsquo;. The analysis of the two positive and one negative case have shown that the past returns to the political agenda because parties aim to change the dominant narrative of the past, but also the narrative of the transition and of the transitional justice process. The absence of post-transitional justice may result from either lack of willingness or capacity, but while the latter may represent a short-term constraint, the former is likely to be more structural and therefore more enduring. Hence, understanding the qualitative dimensions of &lsquo;willingness&rsquo; to bring back the past (or the lack thereof) seems to lead to a more solid knowledge about the ongoing impact of authoritarian legacies in consolidated democracies. There are two major conclusions to be drawn from these cases: first, post-transitional justice seems to be more likely to occur when democracy emerges from a negotiated transition instead of a clear break with the past; second, post-transitional justice seems to be more likely to occur when the former elite has been legitimized in the new regime and has had formal access to government."

The point of departure is the, by now widely accepted, conceptualisation of the EU as a polity and the extensive discussions, not least in normative and prescriptive terms, that this process implied. Judging that many of the debates have reached dead-ends, the thesis proposes a novel way of conceptualising the concept &lsquo;polity&rsquo; in its application to the European Union. It argues that the European Union polity should be understood as a configuration of agreements to collectively address common problems. The thesis then offers an analysis of three such fields of agreed upon common activities over the period 1992 to 2005 which are constitutive of the European Union polity and construct its boundedness: &lsquo;Enlargement to the East&rsquo;; &lsquo;Immigration policy&rsquo;; and &lsquo;Europe as an actor in the world.&rsquo; Under scrutiny includes: the context in which these policies emerged; the normative ideas through which the problems at stake were identified; and the agreed-upon mechanisms for addressing common problems. To understand the emergence and nature of these common activities, the thesis proposes a concept-centred approach. It argues that concepts are constitutive for the European Union polity. The concepts constitute the agreements to address problems in common and thus &lsquo;form&rsquo; the European Union polity. Thereby, the thesis shows the ways in which five key concepts - human rights, democracy, diversity, prosperity and security - are effective (&lsquo;their power&rsquo; or &lsquo;efficacy&rsquo;) and which Gestalt (&lsquo;meaning&rsquo;) they take on in these specific problem-ridden situations. Particular attention is paid to the relationship and, specifically, tensions between the different normative concepts as well as the compromises that they form and the re-configuration of the respective policy fields they bring about. The thesis concludes that these findings should be interpreted as a self-understanding of the European Union. This self-understanding encompasses the commitment to a set of ideas, the decision to take action in certain political domains and, not least, the selfidentification as a political actor and entity. Thus, focusing on the power and Gestalt of concepts without falling into an abstract idealism, the thesis combines an approach of a historical sociology, cultural sociology and the history of concepts with key concerns of European Union studies."

Focusing in particular on the European Commission&rsquo;s role in EU policy-making, this thesis goes on to investigate how actors in EU politics define and redefine the issues at stake according to their shifting policy agendas and in doing so attempt to shore up support and marginalise political opposition. Drawing on the empirical investigation of two decades of EU biotechnology policy-making, the thesis finds that the framing of policy issues systematically affects how the complex and fragmented EU political decision-making process involves or excludes different sets of actors and interests from the diverse political constituencies of the Union. It argues that the Commission&rsquo;s role in structuring the EU policy space can at times be substantial. Yet the longitudinal perspective adopted in this study also reveals how the structuring and restructuring of the biotechnology policy space led to the increasing politicisation of the EU decision-making process. Eventually, the empirical investigation concludes, the Commission was unable to control the political dynamics set off by the reframing of the policy choices, and the resulting revision of the EU biotechnology policy framework ran counter to the Commission&rsquo;s original policy objectives. This study thus provides fresh insights into the dynamics of policy-level politicisation and its effects on political conflict and competition in the EU. The framing perspective allows students of EU politics to trace how political agents and institutions interact to shape and at times exploit the complexities of EU policy-making in pursuit of their often conflicting agendas. Finally, the findings suggest that the key to conceptualising the scope of Commission agency in terms of systematic policy dynamics lies in exploring the interlocking effects of policy framing and EU politicisation in the political construction of interests at the supranational level."

The significance of viewing the internal bodies of legislatures as mega-seats is that they are conceived as part of the democratic delegation chain. Consequently, such an approach adds a political bargaining dimension to the allocation of mega-seats. During the internal organization process of the legislature, plenary legislators become principals, who delegate power to internal bodies, mainly to enhance labor division, tackle information asymmetries, and channel party demands. This thesis examines the process of payoff distribution in legislatures, using an original dataset containing 350 parties, in 12 Western European parliamentary democracies. The analysis is carried out at the party level as well as at the legislature level. Moreover, I conduct two case studies - Portugal and the United Kingdom - to further disentangle the causal mechanisms used to explain mega-seats allocation in parliamentary democracies. The empirical analysis starts with an examination of whether the division of payoffs (i.e., mega-seats) follows a proportionality logic. The proportionality assumption is borrowed from coalition studies, which have long established that institutional payoffs are distributed in a 1:1 proportionality. Using a new index to gauge disproportionality in the allocation of legislative mega-seats, the first finding of this thesis is that mega-seats allocation in parliamentary democracies is not proportional. Subsequently, I adduce a model that explains this counterintuitive finding at the party and legislature levels. The second main finding is that a party&rsquo;s degree of disproportionality is a function of its power. Parties are conceived as having a number of resources to spend on mega-seats distribution. The way they spend these resources is constrained by the existence of proportionality protection rules within an institution and incentivized by the value of the payoff. Regarding the former, I find that rules matter in protecting proportionality whilst for the latter I find that the amount of resources parties are willing to spend on a mega-seat depends on the mega-seat&rsquo;s power. Finally, the third main finding is that, at the aggregate level, the overall power of the legislative branch vis-&agrave;-vis the executive branch is important in determining the degree of disproportionality. Powerful legislatures tend to be more disproportional, as executive members seek control of its internal bodies."

The tendency to privatize military support functions, however, is also driven by domestic political factors. Drawing on neoclassical realism, I conceptualize the use of PMSCs as a strategy dictated by the need to circumvent the tightening hurdles to the conversion of societal resources into military power. Other things being equal, I argue that the tighter the constraints on the extraction and mobilization of societal resources, the higher the propensity to rely on the market as a complementary source of military power. I provide evidence for this theoretical connection by drawing a comparative analysis between military privatization in the U.S. and in the U.K. Specifically, I investigate in detail the tendency to resort to private military contractors during U.S. military operations in Iraq and U.K. military operations in Afghanistan. In both cases, the privatization of military support functions provided decision-makers with the possibility to circumvent existing constraints over the recruitment and deployment of active duty and reserve military forces. I then assess the explanatory power of my neoclassical realist explanation of military privatization against other theoretical perspectives, developing two competing explanations based on neorealism and organization theory. Although these theoretical perspectives offer valuable insights on the use of PMSCS, I show that due to its emphasis on domestic political constraints neoclassical realism proves better capable of shedding light on the privatization of military support and its variations across countries and over time."

Has Washington&rsquo;s liberal hegemonic leadership proved resilient or are we witnessing a shift towards an imperialist approach to international cooperation marked by a reliance on force and the imposition of policy preferences? This dissertation seeks answers from two angles. First, it argues that the way in which the US government has been dealing with the nuclear non-proliferation regime can teach us about the terms in which it may currently be seeking to shape the unipolar moment in part based on its nuclear supremacy. Through international institutions the powerful seek to shape the behaviour of state-actors in setting constitutive standards for being member of the community of states and norm or rules to regulate behaviour within it. Since the adoption of the National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction in December 2002, we are witnessing the legalization of the regime: The George W. Bush administration has since then adopted a series of policy initiatives formalizing and enforcing core norms of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty based on counterproliferation policy tenets developed at US level since the launch of the Counterproliferation Initiative in 1993. In tracing the adoption and implementation phases of the Proliferation Security Initiative and of UN Security Council Resolution 1540, it scrutinizes Washington&rsquo;s approach to international cooperation and its legitimation preferences to identify elements of hegemonic leadership and imperial domination. Second, it focuses on Washington&rsquo;s evolving relations with France as Nuclear Weapon State and co-constitutive member of the transatlantic security community, Iran as &lsquo;rogue&rsquo; state and India as de facto Nuclear Weapon State outside of the NPT realm. Ties between Washington and Paris are marked by an informal hierarchy, whilst Washington has sought to win India&rsquo;s acceptance of its hegemonic leadership, and Iran has been ostracised from the international community on the grounds of its suspected nuclear military aspirations.

Its empirical material derives from the employment of a qualitative methodology techniques&rsquo; triangulation: archive research, participant observation and semi-structured interviews. I define as Precarious Workers&rsquo; Unions (PWUs) labor collectives the members of which (a) are subjected to atypical labor relations; (b) lack adequate access to the welfare state structures; (c) have developed a collective conscience of belonging to a post-Fordist labor force. The PWUs&rsquo; main characteristics put under scrutiny are: member recruitment, decision-making procedures, services offered, industrial and movement action undertaken. Determinants which I consider as having a significant impact on the above include each country&rsquo;s labor legislation, formal trade union structure, social movement environment and tradition, as well as each PWU&rsquo;s population make-up. A dual comparison is employed. On the one hand, similarities and differences are sought between the Italian PWUs and their Greek counterparts. On the other hand, an internal comparison is conducted between each country&rsquo;s organizations, in order to locate and explain potential divergences from the national model. Despite the fact that the first unionizing initiatives in Greece and Italy were facing similar socio-economic structural conditions, their mobilization developed in a diversified way. Lately, a re-convergence between the two countries&rsquo; PWUs is to be noted: Mixed inside-outside the workplace interventions, a resurgence of mutualist practices and the inability to integrate in the formal trade union structure, combined with a relevant role in the broader social movement activities, are its main characteristics. Furthermore, as derives from the empirical data, attributing a unique class status to the expanding population of precarious workers may lead to erroneous assumptions. The precarious condition is a transversal, passing through the various social strata and is experienced in many different ways. The above is demonstrated not only by the significant impact of the PWUs&rsquo; population make-up on their organizational forms and activities, but also by the fact that, even inside organized labor entities, pre-existing inequalities are neither reversed nor dampened. Finally, the &ndash;partly eclectic, partly innovative- character of the PWUs is leading to the assumption that they are not only challenging the notion of precarity as perceived up to date, but also the very idea of what a union is and how it is supposed to operate. Whether this re-negotiation is to provide an answer to the 30-year-old &ldquo;unions in crisis/union revitalization&rdquo; riddle is not only a matter of the PWUs&rsquo; strategic choices. It is also dependent on the socio-economic context. Future research shall have to examine to what extent the post-2008 economic crisis acts as an accelerator of the tendencies identified, an obstacle &ndash; or a diversion, which shall lead the PWUs to new, unexplored territories."

On the one hand, the European competition regulator has always enjoyed a high degree of formal autonomy from national governments. On the other hand, that regulator has always been embedded in a multi-task and collegial organisation that mirrors intergovernmental politics. Although the literature has often disapprovingly noted this complexity, it has not been explained. Part I elaborates on the theoretical lens for understanding the governance structures of EC competition policy. Despite the prominence of principal-agent models, transaction cost economics seems to offer a more promising venue. The assumption that Member States maximise their total expected gains and postpone excessive bargaining costs leads to the following hypothesis: the greater the preference heterogeneity (homogeneity) between Member States, the higher (lower) the asset-specific investments involved, hence the higher (lower) the risk of post-contractual hold-ups, and hence the more (less) integrated the governance structures created to sustain future transactions. Alternatively, this logic leads to a deterministic hypothesis about the sufficiency of preference heterogeneities for the production of complex governance structures. Part II examines this deterministic hypothesis. Using various sources, and conducting both within- and comparative case- studies, it analyses three important cases: the negotiations of the Treaty of Paris (1951), of the Treaty of Rome (1957), and of the two implementing Council Regulations (1962 and 2003). The evidence shows that (a) the relevant actors do reason in terms of transaction cost-economising, and (b) in the presence of preference heterogeneity, actors create complex governance structures. Nevertheless, it is also found that (c) the transaction cost-economising logic is not as compelling as it may be in private market settings, as bargaining costs are not systematically postponed to the post-contractual stage, and (d) the transaction costs between Member States are not the only relevant costs."

Knowing only which party a legislator belongs to and how the majority of that party voted allows for the identification, with extremely high levels of accuracy, how said legislator actually voted. However, most explanations of why this is the case rests of unsustainable assumptions about the effects of institutions and electoral systems on the behaviour of parliamentarians. Further, most work ignores the most basic explanation of why legislators vote the way they do: Their policy preferences. Without first explaining the role they play in legislative behaviour, little else can be explained with confidence. This work first theorises and develops measures of how parliamentarians&rsquo; policy preferences lead to incentives for them to vote against their party&rsquo;s line in floor votes, and then applies them to a series of diverse institutional setups, showing that while parliamentarians&rsquo; preferences may explain significant parts of parliamentary party voting unity, it is also clear that they cannot, except in rare circumstances, explain all of it.  Having shown that preferences cannot explain unity, this work then argues that by analysing MPs&rsquo; attitudes to party unity, we can understand why MPs choose to vote contrary to what their preferences alone would predict. Applying this logic to parliaments at either extreme of the spectrum of parliamentary institutionalisation, it is shown that there is little evidence that legislators are compelled to act in ways they do not want. Rather, what is found is that they recognise the value of party voting unity and can overcome the temptation to free-ride on their co-partisans.  Finally, analysing floor votes in the European Parliament, it is shown that what explains defection are the long-term rather than short-term goals of parliamentarians, complementing the previous findings."

The focus is on the way in which the organisations have conceptualised contested concepts concerning national minorities, minority rights and minority policy in general, when reacting to the policies of the Hungarian, Romanian and Slovak states that have been directed at the Hungarian minorities. Starting with the assumption that many of the concepts upon which minority policies are based are essentially contested, the thesis sets up a framework for analysing the use of specific interpretations of such concepts in argumentation. More specifically, the framework makes it possible to look at how specific interpretations or conceptualisations of such concepts have been used as implicit warrants. By analysing the use of warrants in the texts issued by the organisations in the arguments reacting to the Hungarian minority policies of the three organisations, the thesis provides a picture of how the conceptualisations of different contested concepts developed. Furthermore, by comparing the use of conceptualisations by the organisations, it is argued that although the organisations started out from different positions, they have gradually converged. And this convergence was centred on the emergence of an ideal minority policy which framed the minorities as unitary entities, which should have the right to influence decisions affecting them as minorities. This convergence was due to the appearance of the Framework Convention on the Protection of National Minorities, increased cooperation between the organisations and the reliance of the EU on the assessments of the other two organisations in the context of EU enlargement. Yet, the organisations have often been incoherent, and have treated different issues from very different perspectives."

And are people in donor countries less supportive of the idea of aid than those in recipient countries? These are the primary questions motivating this thesis, and the results can be summarized by four main findings. One is that the level of economic development, which determines a country&rsquo;s status as a potential aid donor, has a strong influence on support for aid, as citizens of more developed countries are considerably less in favor of increasing aid than others are. The second finding is that, among donor countries, the level of development is positively related to several forms of opposition to the donation of aid. This appears partly due to the fact that more developed countries have donated more aid, for a longer period. Respondents in countries that donate more are more likely to find current levels of international aid sufficient, and this may explain part of the between-country differences. In other words, people in donor countries may find the extent of international aid satisfactory at lower levels than those in other countries. Most notably, however, people in more developed countries are more likely to state disinterest as a reason for not supporting aid, and this reason is the only one that has a clear impact on aggregate levels of support. There is also some evidence that greater donations increase skepticism regarding the impact of aid, but it is not clear that this affects aggregate support. Furthermore, the third finding is that individual beliefs regarding the impact of aid are endogenous to support for aid. While such beliefs appear to influence the support for aid at the individual level, there is also a significant effect of support on the beliefs themselves. The fourth finding is that the negative relationship between economic development and support holds for all but the very least developed countries of the world. It appears that respondents in the latter countries are living under such conditions they lack the critical opinions typically found in more developed countries, making it hard to compare them to those from more developed countries."

By elaborating a sophisticated method for measuring the deliberativeness of the online debates and by analyzing a great variety of online debates our objective is to provide an appreciation of the deliberative potential of the web-debates that avoids shortcuts and inappropriate generalizations, but that recognizes that this may be determined by a multiplicity of factors. From a theoretical perspective the results obtained through our investigations contribute to evaluate whether the deliberative model of democracy could be fostered by the virtualization of the political debates and, more generally, it should also contribute to the elaboration of a deliberative model of democracy that is grounded not only on theoretical principles and suppositions, as this tends to be the case, but also on empirical studies that test its adaptability to the 'real life politics'."

However, despite initial successes, many of these newly created democracies remain weak and have failed to consolidate the process. The European Union was most effective in Southern and Eastern Europe during the 1980s and 1990s, and has since developed further initiatives to promote democracy on a wider scale. My investigation contributes to this literature by studying the European Union&rsquo;s promotion of democracy in Latin America between 1995 and 2005. This region had begun a linear transition toward democracy, but, after more than two decades, it is still unable to capitalise and consolidate its progress. The methodology focuses on the study of the relationship between the donor and the recipient and how such relationship influenced the strategy and impact of the donor&rsquo;s policies. A set of conditions has been selected in order to evaluate the nature of the relationship. This work examines some case studies of EU initiatives promoting democracy in three Latin American countries - Costa Rica, Peru, Uruguay. The strategy adopted in Costa Rica was heavily influenced by the 'Dialogue of San Jos&eacute;' and the democratic development of the recipient country. Since Costa Rica enjoyed some political stability the Union&rsquo;s sub-regional policies could be implemented by Costa Rican-based organisations and their impact proved successful thanks to the support of both domestic political and civil society organisations. On the contrary, the absence of effective political dialogue between Peruvian authorities and the Union from 1995 to 2000 meant that only few small-scale EU initiatives were implemented. However, once stronger political dialogue had been established, in 2001-2005, the initiatives increased in dimension and they were more visible. Finally, in Uruguay very few democracy promotion programmes were applied. Although political and economic agreements were signed between the Union and Uruguay, via the inter-regional dialogue EU-MERCOSUR, Uruguay did not benefit from large-scale programmes due to the relatively advanced level of democracy throughout MERCOSUR. To conclude, I argue that the European Union&rsquo;s programmes in these Latin America countries were influenced by the nature of the relationship between donor and recipient. The evidence suggests that the Union was not capable of enforcing sustainable democratic initiatives without the support of domestic actors."

This period has seen the negotiated reduction of both tariffs and nontariff barriers among developed countries, which allowed for the rapid expansion of trade flows, a driving force of economic globalization. In Protection for Exporters, Andreas D&uuml;r provides a novel explanation for this phenomenon that stresses the role of societal interests in shaping trade politics. He argues that exporters lobby more in reaction to losses of foreign market access than in pursuit of opportunities, thus providing a rationale for periods of acceleration and slowdown in the pace of liberalization. D&uuml;r also presents hypotheses about the form in which protection for exporters is provided (preferential or nonpreferential) and the balance of concessions that is exchanged in trade negotiations. Protection for Exporters includes case studies of major developments in international trade relations, such as the passage of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in the 1930s, the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in the 1940s, the Kennedy Round in the 1960s, the debate over Fortress Europe in the 1980s, and U.S.-European competition over access to emerging markets in the early 2000s.

For example, when Anders Breivik killed 77 teenagers he was declared insane suffering from paranoid and schizophrenia, whereas the perpetrators of 9/11 attacks were described as religious zealots. Unfortunately, the scientific literature also simplifies radicalization and terrorism in a similar fashion; the field is divided between person and situation explanations of terrorism and radicalization. However, to understand terrorism and radicalization adequately the dichotomy of person-situation needs to be readdressed. This dissertation begins to explore the premises that the potential for participating in asymmetrical collective violence must be understood as interplay between intra-individual, social psychological and external/societal factors. Broadly speaking, this dissertation aims to answer the following question: What are the social and psychological factors and processes that contribute to the motivations behind the radicalization of first, second and third generation of Muslim Europeans? This dissertation first addressees the dichotomy of person and situation and proposes an integrated model of terrorism and radicalization. Second, integrating perspectives from various line of research I demonstrate how factors from the different domains of research relate, and more importantly, complement each other in shaping circumstances, which will make radicalization more or less likely to occur. Finally, I explore the influence of person factors such as personality traits. While previous research on extremism and violent has overlooked the potential role of non-pathological personality differences, it is proposed here that non-pathological personality characteristics would predict both violent and non-violent behavioral intentions and actual behavior among Muslims in defense of their group. Therefore, this work aims to extend knowledge on terrorism beyond existing literature, which tends to focus exclusively on either situational factors or psychopathology."

Based on the comparison of historical and qualitative data, it aim is to discuss the existence of an underpinning social experience of democracy that is the ground for, but also goes beyond, the institutional and political definitions of democracy. The thesis argues that, albeit in different ways, diverse public spaces such as public squares and shopping malls are both platforms for democratic practices in contemporary cities. Taking as a backdrop the relatively recent liberalisation processes carried out in Chile and Spain, the study focus on one central square and one shopping mall in each capital-that is, in Madrid the study concentrates in Puerta del Sol and La Vaguada, whereas in Santiago it is based on Plaza Italia and mall Plaza Vespucio. For each setting a twofold question guided this exploration: what are the social and political elements that characterise the transformation of specific locations into particularly significant public spaces and, in turn, how is democracy experienced daily and made viable through social practices within these settings. In order to answer these questions the analysis is based, on the one hand, on urbanhistorical data and newspaper accounts, while on the other hand it relies on the description of the daily routines of three different set of actors linked to these settings: those who relate to them as 'experts' (urban planners and mall developers), those who experience these places as working area, and those who inhabit them as ordinary visitors and frequenters. In spite of the differences among these set of actors and especially between public squares and shopping malls, the thesis defends that both locations serve as platforms for experiencing democracy. Experiences of access, connection, use, exchange, expression and respect are endowed within public squares and shopping malls, justifying not only the individuals&rsquo; appreciation of these locations as valuable public spaces, but also nourishing the idea of what is democracy about and the possibilities one has to experience it directly."

While such limitations are becoming fewer, many democracies retain them even today. Having in mind the strong devotion to the principle of universal suffrage, the persistence of these restrictions prompts an inquiry into the reasons for their enactment and an assessment of their normative value. To situate the problem empirically, the thesis undertakes an analysis of electoral regimes in 43 European countries. An astounding diversity among them is discovered &ndash; regimes range from those with no restrictions to those that restrict the franchise of everyone imprisoned &ndash; and thus possible explanations are investigated. The argument is that the best way to understand a particular electoral policy is to interpret it within the context of what is termed the &lsquo;value of citizenship&rsquo; in a polity. Constituted by a host of social, political, economic and cultural factors, the &lsquo;value of citizenship&rsquo; indicates the level of accessibility and stability of rights attached to the citizenship status. This finding, along with the historical analysis of citizenship ideals, raises a fundamental doubt regarding the nature of criminal disenfranchisement: should it be understood as punishment for crime or is its proper function to sanction the manifestation of &lsquo;bad citizenship&rsquo;? The thesis argues that punishment and disenfranchisement are conceptually different and thus goes on to develop a citizenship-based normative account of criminal disenfranchisement. The fundamental question that guides the subsequent inquiry hence becomes: what should be the normative consequences of the act of crime for one&rsquo;s citizenship status? To answer this question, three distinct accounts of the bond between the citizen and her polity are constructed: the &lsquo;sense of justice&rsquo;, the &lsquo;civic virtue&rsquo; and the &lsquo;common good&rsquo; model. The analysis shows that, regardless of inherent differences, all models deny the legitimacy of disenfranchisement of the criminal population as such, save for the morally incorrigible individuals who have perpetrated crimes immensely detrimental to the polity. The main policy implication of this argument is that permanent exclusions of a very restricted number of asocial perpetrators of the most serious anti-state and anti-personal crimes are permitted, but also that &ndash; even if such restrictions can be considered legitimate &ndash; no polity has a duty to impose them."

The piqueteros movement provides an outstanding scenario for the dynamic analysis of thirteen years of the intertwining logics of both contentious and routine politics. This thesis argues that the complete explanation for the interaction of social movements with state institutions must involve the less spectacular accumulation of ad hoc practices and the use of a predominant repertoire of strategies. The empirical argument of this dissertation is that the period between 1996 and 2009 represented a reshaping of the political arena through the second incorporation of workers under a non-corporatist logic. The territorialized path and specific logic of re-incorporation struggles in Argentina presents us with the crucial question of the redefinition of state-society relations in the post-neoliberal era and its related re-incorporation struggles. The theoretical purposes of this dissertation are manifold. The first is to suggest a refinement of the concept of political opportunities by specifying its logical location in the wider debate about the configuration of the political context for social movement interaction. The second is to propose a series of concepts for the analysis of strategic action in nonrational choice and/or structurally determinist terms. The threefold set of interrelated concepts I propose are: the stock of perceived alternatives; legacies; and repertoires of strategies. The third is to define the type of movement associated with the struggle for the redefinition of the actors to be included in the post-neoliberal political arena. Reincorporation movements have specific attributes that define them as a particular expression of a historical process of struggle for incorporation that emerged with the neoliberal critical juncture. Finally, this dissertation has the goal of bridging the social movement and historical institutionalism literatures with the hope of contributing towards a yet underdeveloped crossfertilization agenda."

The thesis is structured in three different parts. Part I is a systematic reconstruction of historical sources of virtue ethics and republicanism. The analytical focus is placed on Aristotle&rsquo;s and Machiavelli&rsquo;s conceptions of stability (i.e. the avoidance of stasis), and their relevance for thinking on political issues. This investigation into the legacies of republican theory aims to show the multiple faces of republican 'stability' by stressing the differences between the Aristotelian and the Machiavellian projects. Part II studies the contemporary controversies between republican and liberal understandings of political theory. Instead of approaching the subject in adversarial terms, I try to reconcile one perspective and the other by focusing the attention on methodological issues rather than on ideological disagreements. In order to shed light into these theoretical interconnections between liberal and republican standpoints, I explore the republican strands in one of the most paradigmatic examples of liberal thought: the philosophical work of John Rawls (especially in the third part of A Theory of Justice and Political Liberalism). Part III is entirely devoted to the analysis of 'stability' with regard to two particular and contentious issues which have been recently very present in the Spanish political debate - one concerned with political education and the other with national pluralism. This dissertation offers a number of different perspectives, which may paradoxically connote the idea of 'stability' with a sense of untidiness, precariousness and fragmentation. Far from being inconclusive, however, it represents an invitation to consider and balance judiciously different views and perspectives. This is why the concept of stability has been associated with the idea of 'pursuit', as it helps to understand its ongoing, plural and incomplete character. After all, stability is not to be found definitively but to be continuously made, and has not one univocal understanding, but a plurality of them."

The book analyses national imaginations as an on-going reconstruction process in a political and social context in which several imaginations of the nation struggle to impose their conception. Focusing on a fundamental element of any collective identity, namely the &laquo;Other&raquo;, the book looks at the reconstruction of national identities by actors in political debates on immigration in the late 1980s and 1990s, particularly associations and political clubs which were in favour of and against the presence of immigrant minorities in their respective countries. Thus, the book investigates different ways of imagining the same nation in two old European nation-states, namely France and Denmark, which differ with regard to their nation-building processes, their Second World War history, their memory of colonialism and their experience of immigration. It is thus possible to illustrate that existing ideas of the nation and memories of historical events shape the way in which the nation could be re-imagined in the 1980s and 1990s."

This dissertation examines how both states have coped with the consequences of this rapid and unexpected shift. Combining discourse and policy analysis, we look mainly at political elites&rsquo; (parties and their members) discourses and practices, during the first decade of the immigration turn (from early 1990s until the early 2000s). The literature has often treated Italy and Spain as examples of the same &lsquo;Mediterranean&rsquo; group, also usually assuming that they have followed a very similar route towards immigrants&rsquo; criminalization and a populist mobilization of the immigration theme. Adopting an innovative analytical perspective, this thesis arrives at an original understanding of both immigrants&rsquo; representation and immigration politics in Italy and Spain. The predominant categories mobilized by Spanish and Italian political elites in the construction of the immigration &lsquo;problem', as well as the strategies used to seize the (political) opportunities offered by the immigration theme are more diverse than they seem. While in Italy a &lsquo;grammar&rsquo; of insecurity has been reiterated and institutionalized by nearly all political groups throughout the 1990s, in Spain, parties have mostly treated immigration as a matter (problem) of social integration, politicizing (&lsquo;criminalizing&rsquo;) the issue quite late in the decade. This dissertation concludes moreover that the rising influx of immigrants during the 1990s has triggered a revival of particular ways of framing the Italian and Spanish &lsquo;nations&rsquo; and nationhood, which have strongly marked political actors&rsquo; approach to immigrants and immigration politics. In this way, while in Italy the post-Fascist idea of a bounded Italianit&agrave;, grounded on family ties and blood connections, have underlie immigration policy-making; the post-Franquist conception of a &lsquo;new&rsquo;, open and plural Spain has overruled in Spain. We show how these different national &lsquo;mythologies&rsquo; were instrumental for legitimating quite similar (restrictive) policies."

The approach is that of disciplinary history, with discipline defined as a set of practices revolving around disciplinary discourse and around institutional settings for teaching, research, and professional organization. Emphasis is put on studying practices, as opposed to the idealist interpretations of science, and on comparative approach, as opposed to the idiographic one. Chapter 2 maps suppression of sociological institutions in post-WWII Soviet Europe, explaining it as a conflict of habituses between the standing &lsquo;bourgeois&rsquo; sociologists and the Stalinists arriving to power. Chapter 3 studies debates on historical materialism and sociology in the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia as a practice that belonged to the process of establishing the discipline of sociology, and was a good indicator of its progress. Chapter 4 examines the possible continuity with the previous sociological tradition in Czechoslovakia, stating a pronounced discontinuity instead; Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia serve as background cases. Chapter 5 maps the sociologists&rsquo; attitudes to a neglected research topic (ethnicity), a promoted topic (social structure), and their interaction with the Communist Party headquarters. In result, it describes sociology as a project closely related to the reform Party wing and favoring technocratic experts - like the sociologists themselves. Chapter 6 compares the postwar institutionalization of Czechoslovak sociology with twenty-three other European countries. It identifies three typical obstacles to the process, and proposes six institutionalization types in Europe. The thesis concludes by reviewing the 1960s&rsquo; Czechoslovak sociology as a project of a particular age cohort, which had entered the political and academic life in the first postwar years, and dominated the discourse until the 1968 Soviet and allied invasion."

This thesis focuses on reforms of the core democratic rules in Western European democracies during the two last decades, adopting an expansive focus in order to adopt a multidimensional and longitudinal approach to institutional engineering. It investigates the occurrence of reform, successively examining the description and the characterisation of reforms, their contextual determinants and the mechanisms of change, articulating mixed-methods including large-N statistical analyses and case studies. The main theoretical innovation of the thesis is the concept of bundle of reform, defined as institutional reforms linked to each other and relating to several dimensions of the institutional architecture. In the first part of the thesis, thanks to an original database including 6 categories of reform, it is demonstrated that institutional reforms in the last few decades have been frequent, have happened in bundles, and have been moving towards more inclusive institutions. When studying the long- and short-term determinants of the number of reforms, certain long-term factors foster a favourable structural environment for the occurrence of institutional reforms, in particular a lack of political support from citizens for their institutions, but also the disproportional electoral systems in majoritarian democracies. In the short-term, institutional reforms in a given legislature tend to be more numerous after political alternation, and in contexts of rising electoral uncertainty. The thesis also evidences the fact that neither constitutional rigidity nor the number of partisan veto players can be considered to be the main explanation, or even relevant at all in some cases. The second part of the thesis focuses on understanding why, in favourable contexts, some reforms succeed and others fail, investigating case studies of three bundles of reforms in France, Ireland and Italy. The main finding evidences that the final outcomes of reforms are dependent on the combination of the nature of the reforms at stake (divisive or consensual) and the process used to adopt them (majoritarian, supermajoritarian or externalised). Divisive reforms tend to obey a self-interested logic, and their success depends on the ability to build an agreement in relation to a package deal of reforms. During the processes of consensual reform, credit-claiming logics prevail. When the majority chooses to exclude opposition parties and interest groups from the elaboration of reforms in order to claim sole credit, the fate of such reforms depends on the attitude of the opposition, who may choose to oppose the reform in order to symbolically defeat the government."

This study analyzes the transport policy in Italy from the 1990s into the 21st century. It looks at how the two sub-sectors of surface transport, road haulage and raliways, have been managed by the public and private actors involved. In both sectors the policy appears to have failed, either by not offering a remedy to problems or by aggravating them further. The author believes that studying transport policy in Italy will shed light on the wider question of how national policy-making patterns are influenced by developments in the international environment; in this case looking closely at the influence of the European Union."

This has produced substantial divergences in the levels and types of welfare development across regions belonging to the same country. As a result, it has become increasingly difficult to talk about 'national welfare systems' or 'national social models' &ndash; although most of the mainstream welfare literature continues to do so. The aim of this study is to explore the political factors that explain cross-regional variation in the development of health care and social assistance policies in three countries that have witnessed the gradual strengthening of regions as arenas of social policy making: Italy, Spain and Great Britain. The research focus is on the effects of two political cleavages, centre-periphery and left-right, on sub-national social policy. The findings of the quantitative and qualitative analyses presented throughout this research suggest that the main driving force in the construction of sub-state welfare systems is the political mobilisation of territorial identities through the creation and electoral consolidation of regionalist parties. Indeed, such parties may use regional social policy to reinforce the sense of distinctiveness and territorial solidarity that exists in the communities they represent, thus further strengthening and legitimising their political role. Additionally, the centre-periphery cleavage may also affect relations across different organisational levels of 'statewide' parties and further increase the relevance of territoriality in welfare politics at the regional level. On the other hand, traditional left-right politics does not seem to play the central role that welfare theories focusing on 'nation-states' might lead us to expect. For left-wing parties, the regionalisation of social governance may present either an opportunity or a challenge depending on the role they play in national politics and on the characteristics of sub-national electoral competitors. Generally, mainstream centre-left parties are torn by the dilemma of maintaining uniformity and cohesion in social protection across the national territory and addressing the demands for more extensive and distinctive social services coming from specific regional communities."

Family-related migration is based entirely on the individual right to protection of the family of members of society (citizens or long-term residents). However, family migration has recently been the specific target of restrictive policy reforms across Europe. Thus, in a field where, theoretically, the liberal constraint could be assumed to be strongest, there is increasing restriction. How do liberal democratic states manage to restrict migration in spite of liberal constraints? The thesis explores government strategies that restrict spousal migration while staying within the discursive realm of individual rights. By categorising policy instruments into the two approaches of regulating social membership and regulating family ties, a framework for the analysis of family migration policies emerges. Departing from the constructivist perspective that emphasises the importance of the way problems and solutions are &ldquo;framed&rdquo; for any policy analysis, the political debates surrounding spousal migration policies from 2005-2010 in Germany are explored. An analysis of policy documents, parliament debates and in-depth interviews with policy-makers in the legislative and executive reveal the various discursive strategies employed to legitimise restrictive policies or attack them. By circumscribing and scrutinising both the social membership necessary to access the fundamental right to family protection and the family ties in question, restricting spousal migration is legitimised. Supranational EU developments and policy shifts in other European states emphasise the pertinence of the examined German case, as it is situated within a wider European trend. By exploring the perspectives and coping strategies of transnational couples directly affected by the policies in question, a more nuanced understanding of the consequences of regulating membership status and family ties in Germany emerges."

These questions arise from several overlapping puzzles. How is it that in two countries with vocal women&rsquo;s and feminist movements, high levels of violence against women persist and few changes in gender norms are visible? If women&rsquo;s mobilisation during conflict has indeed benefited their post-war social activism, then how come women&rsquo;s organisations remain so dependent on external funding agencies? And how come two countries which are similar in many respects, yielded such different women&rsquo;s movements? Underlying all these issues, is the question of how &ndash; dynamics related to &ndash; the armed conflict influenced the newly emerging women&rsquo;s movements, and what the impact of these dynamics is on the current women&rsquo;s movements. The first part of the thesis considers the role of three important factors related to the armed conflict: the influence of international actors and donors who entered both countries during the armed conflict and post-war reconstruction, the influence of women&rsquo;s revolutionary mobilisation, and the influence of political polarisation on the strategies of women&rsquo;s movements. In addition to this, the role of ethnicity is analysed for the Guatemalan context. The thesis outlines in detail how each of these factors has over time influenced the development of the women&rsquo;s movement, through mechanisms of individual and organisational learning, and through narrative construction and activation by those actors involved. This analysis challenges the commonsensical idea that women&rsquo;s revolutionary mobilisation has prompted a viable form of women&rsquo;s mobilisation in the post-conflict period. Specifically issues of fragmentation, identity formation, financial independence and one-sided goals are discussed. The second part of the thesis investigates alternative strategies to women&rsquo;s empowerment, such as a private approach &ndash; i.e. approaching women&rsquo;s empowerment from the point of view of corporeal and psychotherapeutic feminism. In what ways do organisations adopting a private approach provide new perspectives for the feminist movement? As they articulate new and different goals in the domain of empowerment, they challenge some fundamental ideas on which traditional feminist thinking has been based for a long time. These organisations, Actoras de Cambio, Kaqla and Q&rsquo;anil articulate the need for a different &ndash; Reshaping gender relations in wartorn societies Destrooper v complementary &ndash; conceptualisation of women&rsquo;s empowerment and offer practical means to realise this. They thereby also touch upon issues which have been discussed for a longer time within feminist movements, such as the need for a new language which expresses women&rsquo;s daily experiences of oppression more adequately. Juxtaposing the approach of mainstream Guatemalan and Nicaraguan feminist organisations with the work of three feminist organisations adopting a private approach, implies the recasting of the classic public-private divide. This has implications for the approach and priorities of the present day women&rsquo;s movement in both countries. It leads to the conclusion that there is much potential in both countries for a new form of feminism which uses women&rsquo;s personal lives and experience as a key resource to arrive at a more holistic form of empowerment. The thesis thus not only elucidates how armed conflict has influenced the priorities of women&rsquo;s organisations in Guatemala and Nicaragua, but also contributes to a reinterpretation of female and feminist activism and women&rsquo;s empowerment more generally."

The egalitarian intuition is that any inequality between individuals must be justified by appealing to differences in some responsibility factors. The liberal intuition is that redistribution only can be justified by appealing to differences in some non-responsibility factors. In this dissertation I analyze how a system of unemployment insurance should ideally be designed in order to respect both the egalitarian and the liberal intuitions. The dissertation asks how the different unemployment insurance instruments, such as the UI benefit level, the entitlement conditions, the eligibility criteria, and the distribution of the costs associated with UI should ideally be designed and combined given that the aim is to maximize conformity to both the egalitarian and the liberal intuitions.

Having been previously tormented by the implementation failures and (un-)intended consequences of comprehensive sanctions practice, a scientific question is still warranted when thinking of targeted sanctions: Why is the design and evaluation of this tool in terms of impact so complex and what research approach would be most effective for gaining a better understanding of sanctions 'effectiveness'? To shed light on this question, this research project examines the use of EU and UN targeted sanctions as a means of addressing crises and armed conflicts. Particular attention is paid to the role of restrictive measures imposed on individual entities by the use of travel bans and targeted assets freezes. While decision-makers in collective security bodies have been actively engaged in developing the targeted sanctions instrument, there has so far been little recognition in the academic literature of what consequences targeted sanctions have had for the general theory of sanctions. In this dissertation, I demonstrate how the move from comprehensive sanctions to targeted sanctions requires a re-thinking, in particular when it comes to understanding and evaluating sanctions&rsquo; 'impact'. Starting by illustrating how the shift in thinking has come about and what it has meant theoretically and empirically, the dissertation illustrates various problems in the operation of sanctions. The main aim is to demonstrate the complexity of the sanctions process and the need to think holistically about it. Each component in the sanctions management and implementation process is likely to shape the final impact on the target in a way not always anticipated. Thus, besides the overall puzzle of how targeted sanctions can contribute to conflict resolution, this dissertation seeks to illustrate a number of problems with current practice. Areas addressed herein are: the problem of oversimplification when designing and evaluating sanctions, the problem of mixing symbolic and concrete sanctions, the problem of overlooking targeted sanctions as embedded in a larger strategic setting, the problem of defining a sanctions episode too broad, and finally, the problem of neglecting a target&rsquo;s perception of the imposed sanctions policy. The research project is empirically oriented and contains references to interviews conducted with practitioners working with sanctions policies (with the EU and the UN). Contribution to the field is also made by the inclusion of unique interviews with a number of individuals, which have been included on the EU and UN sanctions lists. In all, the dissertation makes a theory-building attempt by discussing existing epistemological as well as methodological approaches."

This objective is pursued by means of a statistical analysis of large-scale comparable survey data. In short, three points of emphasis characterize this study in comparison with previous research on the topic: 1) the focus on social stratification in terms of gender and class differentials; 2) the central attention paid to social norms of aging; and 3) the joint consideration of individual and country level mechanisms in explaining retirement timing. The review of the previous literature in the second chapter demonstrates that the currently available theoretical approaches by themselves are inappropriate for explaining social variability in retirement timing. Building on the life course paradigm and social class theory, I consequently outline a novel analytical framework for the study of differential retirement behavior.  It can be characterized as a choice-within-constraints approach (chapter 3), which essentially focuses on differences between older workers in age norms and late-career opportunity structures, paying special attention on class and gender disparities.  In the fourth chapter, I gather empirical evidence on international and individual differences in retirement age norms in Western Europe on the basis of data from the European Social Survey (ESS). Subsequently, I turn to examining actual retirement behavior in the fifth chapter. Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) a series of event-history models is used to scrutinize the determining factors of retirement timing at the country and individual level variation. In chapters 6 and 7, two case studies on Germany and Spain examine the impact of pension legislation on social stratification in retirement in a detailed manner. The two country studies are based on ad-hoc module on the transition from work into retirement, which has been implemented in the respective national labor force surveys (Encuesta de la Poblaci&oacute;n Activa (EPA) and Mikrozensus) of 2006."

This is pursued in three independent studies, each of which is presented as a stand alone chapter. Chapter 2 has shed some light on the relative importance of the dimensions of concerted cultivation in accounting for the children's differences in reading ability and locus of control across socioeconomic groups. The results show that it is the engagement in cognitively stimulating and reading activities and not the participation in organized activities more generally that enhances children's reading ability and the locus of control. Path analyses confirm that the selected dimensions of parent-child cultivation - parental expectations, direct stimulation, parental interactions with the school and children's engagement in cognitively stimulating activities - mediate the socioeconomic gradient in children's reading ability and the locus of control, even after controlling for the previous level of abilities. In addition, the effect of parent-child cultivation is stronger than that of parental socioeconomic characteristics. Using instrumental variable technique, chapter 3 detected both the upper bound and lower bound estimates in the range of variations of returns to education. The inclusion of pre-school ability and birthweight to detect the upper bound effect yielded higher estimates of the impact of education on occupation than did OLS models. The model designed to detect the lower bound estimate of the education effect used the mother's smoking habit during pregnancy as an instrument and yielded consistent and substantial estimates in some cases. These results are in line with a local average treatment effect interpretation of instrumental variables estimates of education which states that IV identifies the effects regarding only those who change their behavior as a response to the instrument-mechanism.  As the competence accumulated before starting formal education increases the returns to additional education, most students will profit from attending schooling, although to a decreasing extent as we observe less and less able children. Only a minor proportion of children with extreme cognitive (dis)advantages will probably not take advantage of school attendance, at least in relation to occupational and cognitive outcomes. Chapter 4 has contributed to the research on the impact of so-called non-cognitive traits on socioeconomic outcomes. Drawing on strain theory, it confirms that the child's adaptive strategies as indicated by acceptance of school and goals of socioeconomic success capture key aspects of the non-cognitive processes in educational and occupation attainments. They also account for the bulk of the impact of parental background on the child's socioeconomic outcomes. The results are validated against other competing factors, such as leisure activities and psychological traits, which turn out not to be substantially associated with educational and occupational outcomes."

In 1993, Estonia became the first post-communist country to introduce a Flat Tax regime, and its neighbors, Lithuania (1994) and Latvia (1996), soon followed suit while in 1995 Hungary reduced its CIT (Corporate Income Tax) rate to 20%, the most competitive rate in the region. Between 1999 and 2003, most of the 10 NMS countries enacted significant CIT cuts and by 2010, 9 out of the 10 NMS introduced some form of Flat Tax regime, and CIT rates were significantly cut, making the region one of the most tax-competitive in the world. I aim to explain variation within two different independent variables, the most important direct taxes in almost any tax system in the world: CIT and PIT. The variation of the independent variables and the presence of various explanatory factors are assessed qualitatively by analyzing thirty policy reform processes within the ten countries and quantitatively by analyzing various statistical data regarding the evolution of different indicators. The explanatory power of seven theretical approaches is tested: the (1) external pressure, (2) competitive, (3) institutionalist competitive, (4) rational learning, (5) cognitive heuristics, and (6) emulation approaches to the process of policy diffusion, as well as Kingdon&rsquo;s (1984) (7) Multiple Streams Model. I argue that Kingdon&rsquo;s MSM represents an adequate model to analyze policy change as a diffusion phenomenon and allows me to offer a more complex, less parsimonious but more realistic account of the causal factors that account for the observed changes. This interpretation within the MSM stresses the relevance of different configurations of causal elements determining change in each of 10 NMS."

To do so I look at the 'life cycle&rsquo; of activism and the various roles played by the difference emotions inherent in each stage  growing interest, finding likeminded others, joining a group, the process of bonding, the establishment of ties, then the eventual dissolution or constant reaffirmation of identification as an activist. By exploring the part played by emotions in these various stages, we can better understand the motivations and experience of those involved, in order to broaden our understanding of social movement participation more widely."

It notes the pervasiveness of the dramaturgical analogy&mdash;or the metaphor of the &lsquo;world stage&rsquo;&mdash;in reference to the behaviour of states in international affairs, but the general silence from International Relations (IR) as to the importance of the concept for the theory and practice of international politics. The thesis consequently puts forward an &lsquo;interactionist&rsquo; approach to state roles, based on a reading of symbolic interactionism that, it is argued, can solve a number of the problems identified in the limited number of theoretical treatments of roles found in the literature. Such an approach focuses on the way shared understandings of a state&rsquo;s proper place in the world, or its &lsquo;role&rsquo;, emerge and change through particular interactions. This lens is brought to bear on the case of Britain&rsquo;s changing role in the post-War world, which, it is contended, offers a particularly salient example of a state that has altered the bases of its international relations in the recent past. Four episodes of Britain&rsquo;s post-War foreign policy are then analysed in depth in order to gauge the changing meanings associated with Britain&rsquo;s role on the world stage: the &lsquo;Skybolt crisis&rsquo; of 1962, the withdrawal from East of Suez in 1968, the Falklands War of 1982, and finally Britain&rsquo;s involvement in the international intervention in Kosovo between 1998 and 1999. It is argued in conclusion that the approach outlined in the thesis provides not only a more fine-grained analysis of Britain&rsquo;s post-War experience than the dominant narratives represent, but that it also offers a useful theoretical framework with which to approach the study of state behaviour in international politics, one that significantly advances theorising within the constructivist paradigm and the English School tradition."

While the school of democracy hypothesis has seen a recent renewal, little empirical research has been carried out in order to evaluate it rigorously. I tried to answer this crucial democratic question by leading an ethnographic study in three cases of municipal participatory budgeting in France, Italy and Spain. They indeed appeared as good training grounds for individuals, as they are empowered institutions that aim at including lay citizens in the discussion and production of local public policies. After almost two years of precise micro-sociological research, I saw people change, sometimes radically. Some, disappointed by their experience, became increasingly cynical about participatory democracy and politics in general. Many others however acquired new civic skills and competences, a wider knowledge of their environment and of the political system, and became increasingly involved in associations, social movements and political parties. Some even became professional and were integrated in municipal electoral teams. Participatory democracy has therefore the potential to empower citizens and create new local elites - be they critical ones, re-boosting civil society, or institutionalised ones, regenerating representative government. Some specific factors appeared crucial in the pattern of self-change I observed. Firstly, the biographical availability and previous political experiences of actors had a decisive impact. Secondly, self-change required mastering the discursive rules of competent behaviour of the institution - what I call their grammatical rules - to be integrated and thus experience intensive participation. Mastering the norms of good behaviour in public - learned through trial and error, and from sanctions and rewards mechanisms, i.e. from the power of the emotions felt in public and especially under the eyes of unknown strangers - people had then the chance to see their personal and political trajectories more radically affected. The individual impact of the involvement in participatory democracy institutions seems therefore to be both the increased civic competence of actors, but also the exclusion of the unskilled and incompetent citizens. The process of self-change can therefore appear as both fostering emancipation and exclusion."

It argues than in addition to top down reforms of the organisations which populate the different level of the Chinese research system this development was made possible by the return of foreign trained researchers. These returnees introduced not only the latest scientific knowledge and skills, they had also been socialised in a Western research setting. The introduction of these actors helped facilitate the institutional and organisational changes which took place in the last decade. In addition these returnees possessed an international scientific network and by remaining in contact with their foreign peers they helped the Chinese research system to 'open up' to the rest of the world. The main aim of this thesis is to explore how the Chinese research system in general and China&rsquo;s plant molecular life science research in particular has evolved and internationalised in the past twenty years, and what role scientific mobility has played in this process. Part I presents the theoretical and methodological framework upon which the analyses in the three further parts are based. Collectively, the analyses presented in four chapters of Part II aim to provide an insight into how the Chinese research system has modernized and internationalized in the past two decades. The three chapters of Part III use bibliometric analyses to provide an insight into the changing role of the Chinese research system within the global science system and how this change is related to patterns of scientific mobility. Finally the three chapters of Part IV are built on individual level data and their main aim is to explore the different roles of returned scientists in more depth. The concluding chapter 15 returns to the research questions formulated in chapter four and to how these questions have been answered by the analyses presented in the different chapters. It continues by discussing the potential implications of these answers to the existing literature and policy."

The quantity of research on the judiciary does not compare even remotely to the vast literature on others institutions. However, despite the relative inattention to their role, courts are institutions whose performance has concrete and relevant effects on the socio-political system. Indeed, Courts have currently emerged as active participants in the political process offering new opportunities to citizens, social movements, interest groups, and politicians. Focusing on three countries of Central America (Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Guatemala), this dissertation illustrates how far the political system in these countries is shaped in significant ways by the role of Courts as political institutions. Throughout a comparative approach, this study offers what may be the first cross-national analysis explicitly designed to serve as a comprehensive measure of the political role of High Courts."

One big chapter of this reform dealt with senior personnel policy. New procedures were implemented, merit was upgraded as the main criteria for senior appointments, and compulsory redeployment was introduced. Against this background, the research was conducted in order to assess the extent to which these new measures have changed the way senior appointments take place inside the Commission, particularly in terms of influence coming from national governments. By assessing several hundred appointments and redeployments of director generals, deputy director generals and directors - and through interviews with 37 top Commission officials - the thesis revealed what substantive and systemic changes have progressively taken place since the early years of the Prodi Commission, as compared to the pre-reform situation (i.e. Santer Commission). Principal-agent theory was used to frame the research and derive the main hypotheses on the possible development in the relation between EU member states and the Commission. Among the main overall findings of the research, the empirical assessment revealed that 1) the role played by nationality in senior Commission appointments has undoubtedly decreased with the implementation of the reform; 2) the role of member states in senior appointments has changed little from Santer to Prodi, due to the complementary finding that this role was already rather limited prior to the reform (a finding which runs against the mainstream literature on this issue); 3) mobility was a senior management tool that certainly helped the Commission to bring forward change to the administrative culture, but did not come to represent a tool used to resist member states&rsquo; pressures; and 4) unfit candidates have no longer a chance to be promoted to the upper echelons of the Commission administration."

More specifically, I study how the interaction of different forms of inequality shapes the opportunities of individuals in a series of outcomes. The main source of inequality explored here is that which derives from ethnicity and migration status. Alongside this, two dimensions of inequality are also explored: social origins and the characteristics of the neighbourhood of residence. The analysis, carried out for second generation ethnic minorities (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Caribbean and African) and the white British, is based on rich individual, household and neighbourhood-level data: the ONS Longitudinal Study, a dataset that links census information for a 1% sample of the population of England and Wales and to which it is possible to attach household and neighbourhood information, and aggregated census data (1971-2011). I show that ethnic penalties in the labour market are, partly or totally, penalties related to the socio-economic origins of ethnic minorities, usually less advantaged as compared to that of the white British. This suggests that scholars in migration might overestimate the ethnic gap if social origins are not considered. A second crucial finding is that the geographical space is a source of production and reproduction of ethnic inequalities. Three outcomes support this. First, I found evidence of ethnic enclave and place stratification spatial models: most ethnic minorities, but particularly individuals with lower educational and occupational attainments and Pakistani and Bangladeshi populations, are less likely than the white British to improve the neighbourhood in which they were raised, both in terms of deprivation levels and in terms of the share of non-whites. Second, I found evidence of neighbourhood effects: having been raised in areas with a high share of co-ethnics has a negative effect on the labour market outcomes of some groups, mainly Pakistani and Bangladeshi. Third, I found evidence of increasing spatial segregation: between 2001 and 2011, non-whites, and in particular Pakistani populations, increased their spatial clustering and their likelihood of sharing the space with other co-ethnics."

Bridging migration theory and comparative political economy, it is argued that variation in labour market institutions shapes variation in levels of labour immigration and the type of employment undertaken by migrant workers across advanced democracies. This theory is supported by empirical evidence from Western Europe and in particular Italy and Ireland. Furthermore, it is explored whether, given the relationship between labour market institutions and labour immigration, policymakers are stimulated by concerns regarding immigration - the &lsquo;Migrant Worker Factor&rsquo; - to reform labour market institutions. More specifically, it is investigated whether the Migrant Worker Factor stimulated employment standards compliance (ESC) system reforms and the development of active labour market policy (ALMP) in Ireland, Italy and shadow cases Britain and France during the period 1997 - mid 2008. It is also explored whether the Migrant Worker Factor was part of the rationale behind vocational education and training (VET) system reforms of the same period in Ireland and Britain. These case studies found empirical evidence that concerns regarding labour immigration can be a causal factor in the reform of labour market institutions. Certain ESC system reforms were partly motivated by the aim of safeguarding domestic worker jobs and employment standards, as well as controlling migrant inflows. Moreover, in some cases, ALMP development and VET system reforms in part aimed to provide domestic alternatives to migrant workers. The impact of the Migrant Worker Factor depends on the level of concern regarding labour immigration in a given state. Furthermore, the influence of this variable on labour market institutional reform is mediated by learning and coordination mechanisms and assumptions regarding the substitutability of migrant workers. The Migrant Worker Factor is also more likely to stimulate labour market institutional reform when there are converging political or structural pressures for reform."

Claiming that France and the UK have faced a similar type and level of threat from Islamist terrorism in recent years, the thesis shows that British and French officials&rsquo; similar perceptions of the militants facing them (as unrestrained and focused on producing mass casualties) has led both states to adhere to a preventive logic of counterterrorism. In this context, there has been some convergence between the two states&rsquo; counterterrorist legal frameworks and operations. Notwithstanding these common elements, I argue that different domestic institutional conditions and normative contexts in the two states are proving to be powerful factors for divergence between their respective responses to Islamist terrorism. Institutional legacies - at both the state and organisational levels - affect whether and how counterterrorist agencies and different branches of the state work together in the fight against terrorism. The contrasting institutional conditions found in Britain and France mean that the two states have achieved different types and degrees of co-operation between counterterrorist intelligence, law enforcement and prosecution. The thesis also argues that a normative consensus on security issues in French society allowed the authorities there to be considerably more draconian in their application of terrorism powers than the British, who were constrained by the high level of norm competition in their society on these issues. These different normative contexts also account for the significant differences between the two states&rsquo; operations against suspected Islamist terrorists and their supporters. By drawing on neo-realist theory, new institutionalism and constructivism in a study of a top priority area of states&rsquo; security policies, the thesis has implications for a number of theoretical debates as well as for understandings of western responses to terrorism in the 'post-9/11' world."

Within Treatymaking  processes, actor influence is here expected to vary according to the institutional preconditions, and small states are presumed to benefit from particular type of decisionmaking  rules to the disadvantage of others. The fundamental aim of the study is therefore to  investigate the conditions under which small state influence increases in European Union  Treaty-negotiations. To explain this puzzle, a distinction is made between two types of  Treaty-making processes, those of the Intergovernmental Conferences and the Convention,  which allows for subsequent comparisons between the decision-making rules of unanimity and restricted consensus. In order to empirically test the underlying hypotheses, explicit units of observation are chosen from the IGCs of Amsterdam, Nice and 2003-04, and the Convention on the Future of the EU. In-depth comparisons are made between four small Member States &ndash; Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Ireland &ndash; and their de facto influence is process-traced through three substantial issues of the institutional reform: the composition of the Commission, the extension of qualified majority voting and the reform of Council Presidency. The empirical analysis focuses on both informal and formal levels of decisionmaking dynamics, and a further analytical distinction is made between bargaining and deliberation modes of conflict-resolution. Drawing initially on theories of rational choice institutionalism (RCI) and liberal intergovernmentalism (LI), the unanimity rule as applied in the IGCs is expected to strengthen the formal position of an individual small state by providing, respectively, a veto-right for each negotiator and promoting asymmetric interdependency. The empirical findings confirm the major underlying hypothesis concerning the correlation between the adopted decision-making rules and the small states&rsquo; impact on distributional outcomes in the EU Treaty-amending negotiations on the one hand, and the superiority of the unanimity rule for small states on the other. Yet, a couple of additional key success factors &ndash; other than can be explained exclusively along the conjectures of RCI or LI schools &ndash; are also identified in the study."

It addresses three main sets of questions. First, how is the currently dominating dichotomous approach to tackling the problem of justice beyond state borders inadequate; and how might its inadequacies be addressed by going beyond such an approach? Second, what kind of normative principles should be satisfied in the context of the WTO so that the multilateral trading system fulfils relevant demands of fairness and justice? Third, how can the fulfilment of these principles be improved? This thesis thus analyzes the relationship between justice and the WTO from a dual perspective: it explores both what the existence of the WTO implies for theories of justice beyond state borders and how normative political theory helps to address governance challenges in the context of the WTO. The thesis thereby contributes to the literature on transnational socioeconomic justice, the normative assessment of international trade, above all in the context of the WTO, and the ongoing debate about reforming the multilateral trading system. The thesis has three main parts. The first part addresses the nature of principles of socioeconomic justice. It examines procedural and substantive principles as well as comparative and non-comparative principles in light of current debates about commutative, distributive and sufficientarian justice. In the context of the WTO, this thesis makes the case that substantive principles of a comparative nature matter in the international arena even if we were to initially restrict our attention to sufficientarian justice and to ostensibly procedural principles of commutative justice. The second part focuses specifically on substantive principles of socioeconomic justice beyond state borders. It critically discusses the current theoretical landscape and develops and defends a novel conceptual framework for the scope and site of justice. The third part assesses the WTO from a normative point of view in light of the theoretical lens set out in the second part. It argues that the WTO qualifies as a subject of socioeconomic justice, discusses the specific normative standards this entails and assesses the potential and limits of realizing these standards in practice, above all in the context of developing countries in the WTO."

War and civil war as factors in the process of the dissolution and formation of political structures have reappeared even within Europe. In the post-Cold War world politics appears less to be ordered by clear principles. Instead, it is insecure and undermined by violence and instability) It would, however, be misleading to assume that the contemporary experience of eruptive violence simply signifies an aberration from a peaceful path of social and political development. Against the identification of modernization and the gradual decline of (civil) wars, Hans Joas (1996), in close reference to current historical sociology, has emphasized that external and internal forms of armed struggle cannot be seen as deviations, anomalies, or interruptions in the development of modern social and political structures. Rather, they represent their inherent feature.2 According to his view, (civil) war and violence are constitutive parts of mRdernity and not its prehistory; the ongoing military and armed conflicts are thus only a reminder of this close connection. How should political theory react to the central role of (civil) war and armed violence in shaping modern political structures? If current historical sociology is right that (civil) war and armed conflicts lie at the foundations of modern politics, political theory would find its overriding field of interest in the conceptual analysis of politics and violence."

We talk about state autonomy, suggesting states have the capacity to deliberate and determine their own destiny. We discuss constraints on state action and debate the legitimacy of interference in the affairs of other states. We also measure and assess state development, suggesting a potential in states for self-realisation. The concept of sovereignty, and the belief that this principle demands the rejection of the subjection of states to higher authority, frames much of our thinking about world politics. Such issues lie at the heart of much of our theorising of IR: in realism's security dilemma, for example; in liberal debates about humanitarian intervention; or in constructivist analyses of the relationship between sovereignty and state identity. It is a central contention of this thesis that conceptions of state freedom are present in the deep analytical and normative presumptions of much of the theory of international relations. The conceptions of state freedom that inform such theorising remain, however, for the large part implicit. The principal purpose of this thesis is to remedy the absence of sustained, explicit consideration of the concept of state freedom, and it does this by historically excavating ideas about what it means for states to be free. While explicit discussion of the freedom of states was prominent in the 17th and 18th century, as the state's position as the locus of political authority was gradually consolidated the terminology of state freedom diminished in salience. Ideas of state freedom did not disappear, however; they continued to be expressed in analogous areas of international discourse. Drawing on philosophical ideas about individual freedom, this thesis presents a theoretical approach to making such implicit ideas visible. It makes the case for a 'grammar' of freedom, which, it is argued, enables one to distinguish ideas about freedom from other species of ideas but does not prejudice their substance. The thesis then employs this grammar to identify ideas of state freedom in international debate surrounding three cognate concepts: non-intervention, sovereign equality and self-determination. Through analysis of the arguments made by states-people about these three concepts, the thesis articulates a number of evolving ideas about what it means for states to be free and unfree. That historical investigation uncovers both a strong normative preference among practitioners of international relations for the freedom of states and sharp disagreement about what constitutes that freedom. The thesis argues that the contestation surrounding ideas of state freedom have played an important role structuring legitimate relations of control between states. The thesis concludes by reflecting on the implications of these observations for the approaches of theorists of international relations to the key concepts of sovereignty and the state."

The study is hypothesis-generative, based upon qualitative research. The cases are selected from one ongoing process of state transformation at the Arctic fringe of Europe. An indigenous rights struggle feeds into the ongoing re-constitution of the body of law. The study contributes to an ongoing re-thinking of concepts and methods in European Political and Social Sciences. The struggle for rights is also a struggle for proofs, which feeds into ongoing re-constitution of the body of knowledge. Positive findings describe my attempts to observe some possible causal mechanisms whereby the indigenous human rights movement has enjoyed some limited success in its effort to decolonize the four states that have divided and conquered S&aacute;pmi, the homeland of the S&aacute;mi (formerly known as Lapps), the only group within the EU recognized by the UN as an indigenous people. Negative findings describe my attempts to observe some limitations of my own observational capacity. Many questions of relevance to subaltern interest groups remain under-researched and under-documented: There is a great deal of colonial bias that must still be overcome, not only within European political science at large, but also within my own limited contribution, even though I strive to overcome such bias. Seven empirical chapters, discuss two single-case studies: Alta Watershed, ca. 1970-1980, and Deatnu Watershed, ca. 1980-2012. The empirical foundation is qualitative data from field observation and historical archives, which is put ino context with some quantitative data from official registers. The different chapters operate within different disciplines: two are geographical, two are sociological, one is historical, one large one is anthropological, and one should be regarded traditional political science. Although multi-disciplinary, my empirical research continues what I call the major research tradition in the field. This focuses on collective action and social ecology, and informs human rights policies. The theoretical discussion addresses observations by colleagues within another, rival, tradition, which emphasizes coercive force and geo-strategy, and serves public security policies. Transformative social movements need to be aware that both traditions remain limited by a heritage of colonial bias. They also need to be aware that both traditions may be used in a complimentary manner, to help overcoming either fatalism or over-optimism. The thesis concludes that transformative social movements need to avoid the dual pitfalls of na&iuml;ve idealism and na&iuml;ve realism, and pursue critical realism."
"http://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/10458","Statist Cosmopolitanism","2008","YPI, Lea Leman","Cosmopolitanism; State, The","The thesis defends a particular version of cosmopolitanism: statist cosmopolitanism. Its point of departure is the current debate in international political theory on the moral standing of boundaries and the scope of distributive equality. Against existing cosmopolitan approaches, it is argued that states have an intrinsic normative standing and constitute the most relevant agents of global justice. Against non-cosmopolitan approaches, it is argued that the defence of compatriot favouritism in the distribution of egalitarian obligations rests on a confusion between motivation and principles in ethical reasoning. More positively, this research claims that the state is not only compatible with the cosmopolitan defence of distributive equality but also necessary for its realization. The work is divided in three parts. The first part introduces some preliminary observations and illustrates the historical roots of the controversy between statism and cosmopolitanism with particular reference to the Enlightenment. The second part criticizes cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan approaches to global justice and defends both cosmopolitanism and the state. It illustrates how the limits of cosmopolitan and non-cosmopolitan arguments are due to more fundamental methodological flaws, regarding the place of ideal and non-ideal considerations in normative theories of global justice. The third part reconciles the defence of cosmopolitanism with the defence of the state both at the level of principle and at the level of agency. At the level of principle, it shows how cosmopolitan egalitarian obligations to relieve relative deprivation may be grounded on sufficientarian responsibilities to relieve absolute deprivation. At the level of agency, it argues that those obligations ought to be understood politically - not just morally - and that states constitute the most relevant agents for their realization. Finally, the research clarifies how the transition from principles to agency could be made by local cosmopolitan 'avant-gardes', responsible for acting within the state and thinking beyond it."

By emancipatory communication practices (ECP) I mean ways of social organising that seek to create alternatives to existing media and communication infrastructures. Examples of emancipatory communication practices include independent information platforms, &lsquo;alternative&rsquo; radio and video productions, and the operation of communication infrastructures such as not-for-profit Internet Service Providers. By becoming involved in these activities, activists aim at bypassing the politics of enclosure and control enacted by states and business groups. They seek to empower groups and individuals to communicate on their own terms. The study focuses on two types of ECP that have emerged around an &lsquo;old&rsquo; and a &lsquo;new&rsquo; medium, namely community radio and radical internet projects. I analyse these projects as instances of organised collective action, and look at them through the lens of social movement research. In particular, I adopt an interactionist perspective (Melucci 1996), focusing on sense-making processes. I analyse movement formation and identity processes in order to understand how people mobilise on technological &lsquo;expert&rsquo; issues. I investigate organisational structures to comprehend how organisations reflect the way collective identities are built around technology. I also look at action repertoires in interaction with perceived political opportunities. Not only do ECP activists mobilise &lsquo;inside&rsquo; and &lsquo;outside&rsquo; institutions, they also mobilise &lsquo;beyond&rsquo; (i.e. supposedly independently of) the political process. Finally, I explore the networking strategies of ECP actors, and identify the respective &lsquo;movement dynamics&rsquo;. I analyse whether the collective action observed is a transnational social movement in the making. I argue that collective action on media and communication issues (that includes ECP, but also other groups) can be considered a &lsquo;karst movement&rsquo;. Like a karst river, such movement remains underground, surfacing only when the environmental conditions are favourable (e.g. where a policy window opens or following an episode of repression)."

I argue that the issuing of Executive decrees is a rational policy promotion strategy when the Executive faces bargaining problems in the Legislature, while the level of Executive accountability to the Legislature in terms of amending and rejecting Decrees is determined by the constitutional definition of these acts in favour of either one of the two branches of government. Furthermore, when the Decree is constitutionally defined to enable to the Executive to prevail over the Legislature, the former will issue them excessively, namely at a rate that is higher than that required by the bargaining problems that it confronts in the Legislature. The thesis offers an alternative explanation to the assumption that new democracies are ruled by Executive decree as an outcome of a specific 'dictatorial' culture which perpetuates after the collapse of their authoritarian regime. The disciplined comparison of three study cases with three different political systems and radically different experiences with democracy explores the role of institutional and partisan structures in generating a peculiar style of governance and the Legislatures&rsquo; capacity to keep it under control. The thesis provides a novel methodological model for understanding the governance through emergency Executive decrees across political systems (presidential, parliamentary and semi-parliamentary), while offering a thorough exploration of the theoretical relevance of this particular style of governance from the perspective of quality of democracy."

According to this argument, by cooperating in an intergovernmental setting governments can circumvent domestic institutional constraints, while at the same time keeping the influence of supranational actors at bay. What is the empirical basis of such claims? Do governments&rsquo; institutional preferences indeed reflect strategic attempts at increasing their autonomy vis-&agrave;-vis domestic actors in law enforcement policies, as suggested by some authors? Moreover, once institutional rules have been put in place, are governments able to use these rules so as to circumvent EU level constraints? To answer these questions this thesis examined institutional preferences and strategies of governments at Treaty negotiations and in the day-to-day policy-making process in the policy area of PJCCM. In the first part of the thesis, the alleged connection between institutional constraints governments face in their domestic arenas and their respective institutional preferences at Treaty negotiations was tested. In a second part, strategic interactions between governments in the EU Council and the European Commission with respect to institutional rules in the legislative process in PJCCM were examined. The empirical results of both parts suggest that while only a moderate connection between domestic constraints and governments&rsquo; institutional preference at Treaty negotiations could be identified, there seems to be a systematic relation between rising EU level constraints and strategic institutional choices of actors that reflect motives for autonomy/discretion. The driving factors behind these day-to-day strategic interactions are the ambiguity of and interstitial changes to institutional rules. More specifically, this thesis shows how ambiguous rules over EU competences in PJCCM and changes to these rules via rulings of the Court of Justice lead actors to deploy litigation strategies (Commission), as well as legislative pre-emption strategies (Member States). Furthermore, these conflicts continue to also characterize the policy-making process in PJCCM after formal institutional reforms (post-Lisbon). Going forward, this thesis suggests that more, rather than less, of these strategic interactions will take place in the near future."

Governments come and go, campaigns come and go, policies come and go, and so forth. In representative democracy, the mere existence of elections strongly alters the behavior of representatives who are interested in re-election and of voters who are affected by political communication. Unlike many of our models, the real world structures politics through time, and especially through time between elections. When elections approach, democratic systems seem to be transformed to a degree that facilitates the analysis of a wide variety of campaign effects. Voters and parties do not change significantly through the electoral cycle. Their environment does. The aim of this book is to develop concrete theory for the functioning of political time and to demonstrate its effects with empirical data. At the core of the theory is a dual mobilization cycle. One leg of this cycle concerns the creation and decay of structure in voting behavior. The book traces the causal path preceding the result: the dynamics of voter perceptions, the determinants of party preference, and the logic of turnout and choice. The other leg of the dual cycle concerns the configuration of the party system. Here the causal path leads from the dimensions of conflict within parties over the ability of the leadership to enforce unity in parliamentary behavior to the implementation of campaign strategies. The book also spells out the connections between the two legs and locates them in political time. The methodology developed for this purpose, labeled &ldquo;Quasi Time Series,&rdquo; serves to transform cross-sectional data (which are available in abundance) in a way so that they fulfill functions of time series (which are exceedingly rare). The comparative approach exploits data from several decades, dozens of countries, hundreds of parties, thousands of legislators and about 100,000 voters."

The present research project focuses on the link between descriptive and symbolic representation and seeks to understand what consequences a more proportional political environment produces on the attitudes of both underrepresented and overrepresented groups towards the political system. Women remain among the least politically represented groups and therefore this project focuses on and analyses them in various political positions. Two dimensions of the relationship between citizens and politics are analysed: the level of political engagement and the evaluation of the political system. While there is a clear gender gap in the former, the same does not apply to the latter. This dissertation reaches three important achievements. The first one is to develop the first theoretical framework of the potential causal mechanisms that are likely to operate behind the impact that female politicians have on both women and men. The second is to show that men can indeed be positively influenced  but mainly to clarify that the way they evaluate the political system is nearly the only way they are affected &ndash; their level of political engagement does not change. The third achievement is to show that, while most scholarship has been focusing on the topic political involvement, the presence of female politicians seems to be more connected to the way women evaluate the political system. This means that the &lsquo;role model effect&rsquo; is not the main mechanism at work here. Instead, the idea that the presence of women is necessary to represent women&rsquo;s interests and the fact that they are seen as bringing something new into the political world appear more influential factors. Altogether the signs of the impact of the presence of female politicians are modest."

My preliminary thesis is that ideal political theory is theoretically as well as practically sufficient in terms of providing us with valid normative prescriptions. The first three chapters explore the nature of ideal political theory and provide a qualified defence of its theoretical force whereas the last three chapters are somewhat more practical and focus on whether and how ideal theory can inform political action. In chapter 1 I provide a critical overview of the most recent debates on the nature of ideal theory and show how these are related to meta-ethics. The aim of chapter 2 is to provide a preliminary defence of the necessity and sufficiency of ideal theory for normatively ranking alternative states of affairs as well as for helping us to decide what to practically do. The aim of chapter 3 is to defend the claim that mere incongruence between a theory and the nonideal circumstances of its application does not constitute an argument against its theoretical and practical soundness. In chapter 4 I argue that a fixation on political feasibility, from the part of contextualist political theorists, comes at the price of theoretical incoherence as well as suboptimal and arbitrary suggestions concerning political reforms. In chapter 5 I engage with the real-world problem of climate change and show how ideal political theory can practically serve as a guide for political action in nonideal circumstances. Finally, in chapter 6, I show in what ways the complex reality of partisan party politics and political pluralism is compatible with ideal political theory."

These changes brought about two risks: a weaker dissemination of knowledge due to high access costs to research tools and findings, and the disruption of the norms of openness, traditionally associated with scientific progress. The available empirical studies that attempted to assess the effects of patenting on scientific exchange and on technology transfer often gave inconclusive or inconsistent results, pointing at deeper theoretical and methodological problems. The present study is based on an in-depth analysis of the various IP responses of public research actors in three biomedical fields: genomics, stem cell research and synthetic biology. The study elaborates a typology of public scientists&rsquo; IP responses with respect to research tools and traces the main factors behind them. The co-existence of different and often conflicting IP responses shows that public researchers operate in a hybrid institutional system, which forces them to juggle constantly between the rules of the market and the conventions of 'open science'. Although they are often able to do so relatively smoothly, some responses clearly point at problems and dysfunctions in the patent regime. Moreover, they are indicative of some major changes in the innovation system, where new IP practices and growing science and technology interaction profoundly affect science funding policies, firm creation propensity and the organization of R&amp;D across the public and the private sphere."

In my PhD research project, I studied the extent to which this is indeed and uniformly the case among students; asking whether this explanation is not, rather, part of a discourse that is learned within specific institutional contexts and social environments, and may thus contribute to mechanisms of inequality reproduction. To address this question, I compared narratives of students (a) in American and French universities, (b) in prestigious and less-prestigious universities and (c) from different social backgrounds. The research methods are of a qualitative nature: students&rsquo; narratives were collected by means of forty-three in-depth interviews which I completed with engineering and natural sciences students from different social backgrounds in four selected universities; they were compared with the institutional incentives captured in universities&rsquo; mission statements and selection processes. The interview analysis confirmed the hypothesized influence of academic institutions and social background on students&rsquo; discourse (independently of their actions or experiences) and especially on their use of the apparently very personal self-actualization narrative, for issues such as their choice of study, their priorities in life or their projections for their future. In short, the prestigious American university was the only institution that intensively and successfully encouraged its students to develop a self-actualization discourse, and upper-class students had a relatively greater tendency to develop a self-actualization discourse than middle-class students when facing the same institutional incentives. These findings shed new light on the concept of selfactualization presented by humanistic psychology as the ultimate personal need and goal. Moreover, they are in line with some results of recent studies in the field of cultural psychology (Bowman, Kitayama, and Nisbett 2009; Kohn et al. 1990; Snibbe and Markus 2005) and in the field of comparative cultural sociology (Lamont and Th&eacute;venot 2000; Lamont 1992, 2000); they corroborate recent findings in sociological research on students in higher education (Lamont, Kaufman, and Moody 2000; Mullen 2010); and they resonate with Basil Bernstein&rsquo;s socio-linguistic findings on socially distributed linguistic codes and personal constructs (1975). Considering that the selfactualization discourse may very well have become a selection criterion in western societies and particularly in the western business world, these empirical observations may be socially relevant in that they may highlight not only purely discursive differences, but also possible discursive advantages in the job market for those who master the self-actualization discourse."

Although transnational institutions are typically concerned with prisoners' dilemma-like problems, they often lack the institutional structures required to effectively deal with them. Functionalist, constructivist, and simple rational choice-based theories of international cooperation are weak in explaining such inefficient institutions. I propose a political model of transnational institutional design that places distributional conflict and power at the center of the analysis and links them to formal monitoring and enforcement structures of transnational institutions. Extant work typically focuses on particular forms of power in isolation. A single form of power is, however, rarely a universal source of influence in tripartite institutional bargaining. I argue theoretically and show empirically that states, firms, and NGOs use multiple power variants, such as economic, institutional, and network power to secure favorable institutional choices and that the extent to which different power tools are an effective and efficient means of influence is conditioned by the formality and transparency of the institutional context in which bargaining over institutional structures occurs. As a consequence, changes in the bargaining environment impact the distribution of power among states, firms, and NGOs and, in combination with their preferences, shape institutional choices. Integrating case studies, network analysis, and statistical methods, I draw on data from five negotiation episodes of tripartite institutional bargaining in three transnational institutions&mdash;the Kimberley Process, the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers, and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights&mdash;to probe the explanatory power of my model. This dissertation also makes a methodological contribution that improves researchers' ability to measure the structural properties of large transnational networks constituted by different types of actors."

This dissertation aims to fill this gap in the literature by exploring how migration politics are being fought over not only across society but also across territory in two well-researched cases of protracted nationalist mobilisation, Catalonia and Scotland. It meets three objectives: First, it introduces a theoretical framework accounting for sub-state elites&rsquo; and administrations&rsquo; boundary-making strategies in relation to immigrants and emigrants. Second, it systematically compares the evolution of boundary-making strategies in Catalonia and Scotland, prior to and after the establishment of self-governing institutions. Third, it identifies the circumstances under which nationalists came to adopt a predominantly territorial conception of national membership, privileging the inclusion of immigrants over that of emigrant populations. The main hypothesis states that minority nationalists have a vested interest in emphasizing residency as a significant criterion of national membership irrespectively of one&rsquo;s place of birth and degree of attachment to the land in order to enhance their internal and external legitimacy. In addition, the location of the membership boundary depends upon the relative openness of the Territorial Opportunity Structure, which comprises three dimensions: the formal distribution of migration-related competencies, the initial boundary and its implications for later developments, and the dynamics of party competition at sub-state level. The empirical analysis shows that the attitudes of political elites in Scotland and Catalonia towards immigrants and emigrants have been shifting through time. This illustrates how nations are constantly constructed and reconstructed through processes of boundary-building, in a context also shaped by state-wide nationalism. The findings corroborate to a considerable extent the main hypothesis and show that dynamics of party competition have played a greater role in affecting boundary-making strategies in relation to immigrants and emigrants than historical path dependencies or the formal distribution of competencies."

Social concerns, the welfare state and public opinion towards Europe","2012","BEAUDONNET, Laurie",NA,"European integration challenges the social boundaries of nation states and this phenomenon is not without consequences for individual attitudes. Within public debate, the impact of European integration on the welfare states has been extensively discussed, but we still lack conclusive analysis of the consequences for individual support for Europe. This thesis is an attempt to complement our knowledge on the logics of support for European integration. It investigates how individuals account for the economic and social consequences of integration and documents the logic underlying one the most salient issues in the present debate on Europe: redistribution. It investigates the individual and structural effects of redistribution on attitudes towards Europe, with a particular emphasis on how these effects develop across time and across different national contexts. Specifically, this study determines under what conditions European integration is perceived by citizens as a threat to national welfare regimes, and what are the consequences in terms of political allegiance. The causal mechanism is tested at three levels and over three different periods: at the European level (public opinion in Europe Twelve) and from 1986 to 2010, at the national level (public opinion in the Member states of Europe Fifteen), from 1996 to 2006, at the individual level, in 2009, in the twenty seven Member states of the European Union. Findings show that social protection has both structural and individual level effects on support for Europe, providing a narrative for changes in the level of support for Europe over time and explaining a large share of between-country differences, at the aggregate level. At the individual level, both welfare regimes and welfare issues have a strong impact on support for Europe. When it comes to social protection, the European Union works like a distant, yet strong, threat for individuals."
"http://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/18617","Three Studies on the Sources and Consequences of Social and Cultural Capital among European Adolescents","2011","PROKIC-BREUER, Tijana",NA,"This dissertation has two main themes. First, it studies the role of social and cultural capital in educational achievement from a comparative perspective. Second, it investigates determinants of social trust among adolescents, where the theoretical framework combines insights from both political socialization literature and social capital literature. The core of the thesis is three empirical papers. The first paper is novel in that it explores the relevance of social and cultural capital when measuring improvement in children&rsquo;s educational achievement in two vastly different societies: Eastern and Western Europe shortly after communism. My explicit question is not if social and cultural capital contribute to educational outcomes, but whether this contribution is the same in different societies. In seeking the significance of the role of social and cultural capital, I used data from the Program for International Students Assessment (PISA) and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) which surveyed 50,000 eighth-grade pupils across Europe. Educational performance is measured by pupils test scores in mathematics. The second and third papers elaborate what is the second theme of this thesis: The origins of social trust among adolescents. In order to shed more light on this issue, I distinguish between two different forms of social trust: generalized trust, which indicates how much adolescents trust other people; and political trust, which indicates the extent to which they trust government-related institutions. I conducted an empirical analysis of the data set from the 1999 Civic Education Study conducted on 14-year old students across 18 countries. As a result, the second paper of this thesis examines the origins of generalized trust among the study&rsquo;s sample group, whereas the third paper of this thesis explores determinants of political trust among adolescents. Both papers examine the link between socialisation processes within the family and school and their effects on the development of generalized and political trust. In addition, they utilize institutional theories on the development of social trust, and test the proposition that the quality of governmental functioning affects development of generalized and political trust of citizens."

This view is based on weak empirical evidence: mostly cross-sectional, small coefficients and often a simplistic view about how social comparisons work. This chapter starts by questioning the very basic way in which social comparisons are supposed to be made. It then shows empirically that changes in relative position have no effect on life satisfaction or mental distress, using data from the British Household Panel Survey. The rest of the chapter is devoted to addressing the possible endogeneity of changes on relative income, as well as to carrying out several robustness checks. In most countries individuals of the upper class enjoy more positive emotions and fewer negative emotions than the middle and lower classes. However the size of these differences varies across countries. Chapter 3 attempts to explain where those differences come from using a special SWB module from the European Social Survey that was carried out in 2006 and 2012. The analysis shows that most of the class differences in negative emotions can be explained by differences in health, financial situation, and unemployment. Feeling safe and socialising - while important for negative emotions - do not contribute to the gaps in negative emotions because they are much more equally distributed across classes. Having two rounds of data gives credibility to the results and allows a very interesting description of the emotional changes that occurred with the 2008 economic crisis. Chapter 4 tries to shed light on the issue of work-life balance by exploring the eff ects of working hours on different SWB outcomes using time use data for employees. The analysis reveals that employees experience high levels of enjoyment and satisfaction, almost regardless of how much they work. Unfortunately this is also the case for time crunch - a shortage of time -, which is experienced to a non-negligible extent by all employees. The analysis carried out suggests that there is indeed an optimal number of hours for most of the subjective well-being outcomes considered, but these do not always coincide. However, the trade-offs are greater for individuals that are less satisfied with their jobs. Individuals that are above the median in terms of job satisfaction optimise enjoyment and satisfaction at a positive and large number of hours, whereas for individuals that have low job satisfaction maximising satisfaction and enjoyment at the same time is not possible."

Explaining European shipbuilding policy","2011","WU, Po-Kuan",NA,"Why did European member states agree to liberalise an industrial sector by decreasing the level of state aid allocated to it? In this thesis, I aim to research the neglected study of the European shipbuilding industry from the late 1970s onwards. I first develop some theoretical arguments based on the rational choice institutionalism and bargaining theory. Then, using strategic interaction analysis and conceptual experiments, I propose a number of hypotheses in order to account for the changes in European shipbuilding policy over time. European legislation on state aid to shipbuilding is operationalised in the qualitative index as the dependent variable. The independent variables include the international market, the number of European member states, international agreements and political decision-making rules. After the conceptual experiments, methodologically, I apply comparative statics to empirically assess whether or not the explanatory variables have an impact on the output of European shipbuilding policy. The empirical results indicate that international agreements and decision-making rules may lead to changes in European shipbuilding policy. Furthermore, I extend the argument to another industrial sector, the European aerospace industry, based on the most similar case selection. However, evidence shows that international competition leads to an increase in R&amp;D expenditure in aerospace, while international agreements merely play a marginal role. The different inferences drawn from these two sectors may be a result of their industrial characteristics, and this deepens our understanding for the IPE literature."

Developing the open method of coordination: Education, research and development, social inclusion and e-Europe","2007","DE RUITER, Rik","Social policy -- Europe; Political planning -- Europe; Welfare state","This thesis addresses the questions of why national governments choose the OMC and, especially, which factors explain the degree of development of its infrastructure (i.e. the presence of guidelines, indicators, benchmarks, National Action Plans, and peer review). The positive correlation between the development of the infrastructure of an OMC on an issue, and the saliency of this issue in the eyes of the public is taken as a starting point for answering these questions. It is claimed that national governments opt for an OMC with a highly developed infrastructure when they have an incentive to act on an issue on the European level, and at the same time fear a shift of competences because of the saliency of this issue. This conflict is reinforced when the particular issue forms part of the electoral profile of a political party in government and there is public support for more EU involvement with regard to this issue. The stronger the reluctance of member states to act on the European level, the more member states see a necessity to erect a barrier against a shift of competences, and the more the infrastructure of the OMC will be developed in order to prevent a shift to a less intergovernmental governance mode. In this way, the degree of development of the OMC is expected to be positively linked with the capacity of the OMC to function as a barrier against a shift of competences. For assessing these claims, four policy fields on which the Lisbon Council decided to adopt an OMC are selected: education, research and development, social inclusion, and the e-Europe initiative."

The European Parliament as the only directly elected EU institution is logically one of the 'closest' linkage institutions to the European electorate. However, little is known about how its representatives - Members' of the European Parliament (MEP) - connect, service and cultivate relations with their constituencies between two elections points. This thesis attempts to fill in this missing link. Using original data from the author's self-administered 2009 MEP survey (N=145), this thesis empirically traces MEP's constituency orientations in three steps. It first maps out MEP constituency orientations in terms of MEP's attitudes / how they think about a their constituencies, the importance they attach to constituency work and the types of activities they pursue in their constituency work. Given that MEP function in an ICT era, in addition to mapping MEP's constituency outreach offline, as part of the second step, the thesis also evaluates how MEP incorporate ICTs and Internet platforms in their constituency outreach. Could it be that the various interactive, transactional and asynchronous features that the Internet provides prompt MEP to use their websites, blogs or social networking sites as quasi virtual constituency offices? In view that a fair degree of variation was found in MEP's constituency outreach, the third last step looks at the determinant of this variation. Overall, the thesis' findings demonstrate that in spite the low institutional and electoral incentives for them to engage in constituency work, MEP conduct a wide range of constituency outreach activities both offline and online. Moreover, citizens contact MEP with diverse types of casework. At the same time data also showed that majority of MEP still prioritize and attach more importance to their legislative duties as oppose to their constituency work. With respect to MEP's Internet usage, the thesis findings further suggest that it is yet premature to conclude that the 'virtual constituency office' is replacing the conventional constituency (offline)."

The impact of public services on income distribution: An international comparison","2011","VAALAVUO, Maria",NA,"The main objective of this doctoral thesis is to examine how public services impact on inequality in income distribution in fourteen European countries. In other words, it investigates how adding the monetary value (equalling to cost of production) of public childcare, non-tertiary and tertiary education, health care and elderly care services to a household&rsquo;s disposable income alters income distribution and how efficiently public services work in the mechanism of redistribution. Moreover, it studies how the public spending on these services is distributed across income classes and household types. Many previous studies have already hinted that the omission of services from welfare state research may contribute to a biased and deficient understanding of social policies. Besides, the inclusion of these categories of social spending is likely to influence not only countries but also income classes and household types in distinct ways &ndash; making this study all the more significant. While previous studies may have incorporated health care and non-tertiary education within the concept of income, this thesis presents the first attempt to include childcare and elderly care services in research on income distribution, as well as a more thorough analysis of higher education. Likewise, the use of a wider comparative perspective to examine income inequality in social-democratic, conservative, Mediterranean, postcommunist, and liberal welfare states contributes to the existing literature on European social policies. The results of this thesis illustrate that in-kind benefits can function as a redistributive tool in European welfare states. Firstly, the quintile share ratio decreased on average by a third when moving from disposable income to final income (excluding higher education that is more pro-rich). Secondly, however, the variation both between countries and services is considerable, and thus different in-kind transfers should be analysed separately: the greatest impact on inequality is achieved through non-tertiary education and health care (17 and 16 per cent reduction respectively), while the inclusion of childcare and elderly care reduced inequality by 4 and 6 per cent on average. In the social-democratic cluster, elderly care contributed much more efficiently on equal distribution of resources than elsewhere. Thirdly, we observe a pattern of redistribution towards the poor, even within subgroups. Fourthly, the clustering of countries did not show a coherent pattern and it is especially hard to fit childcare to the traditional welfare state regime typology. Finally, we see that it is not only the level of public spending, or the comprehensiveness of coverage, that influence the received results in one direction or the other, but also the socio-demographic structure of society and the equality of access to services. In conclusion, further research should be conducted on the regional variations of the quality and quantity of services provided. Likewise, more effort should be devoted to studying the inequality of access to different services (as undertaken here with higher education). In the context of economic crisis and concern about the sustainability of public provision of services, this thesis aims at providing important evidence about egalitarian consequences of potential political reforms in the public services sector. Whilst not the raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre of services, redistributive effects should be considered when adjusting social policies to face the challenges of modern societies."

H.","Citizenship -- European Union countries","This thesis asks what kind of conception(s) of citizenship that have emerged over time within the European integration process. The starting point for this research aim is a critique of the existing literature on European citizenship. Research on European citizenship has tended to fall into a sceptical strand relying on the nation-state model of citizenship (often called the no demos position) or a more visionary strand which interprets the developments of rights on the EU level as a postnational disconnection of citizenship from nationality. These normative strands have tended to translate the question of 'what should it be?' into factual statements on what citizenship in the EU actually is. This thesis has sought to overcome this through a theoretically informed, yet empirically oriented study of how conceptions of European citizenship have developed. Theoretically, the thesis eschews the typical model approach of citizenship studies. It does so by focusing on citizenship as a status of individuals constituted through four analytically distinct, yet potentially inter-related dimensions: membership, rights, participation and identity. This provides a dynamic theory of citizenship where the appearance of and relationship between dimensions is not settled a priori, but rather needs to be scrutinised in practice. Empirically, therefore, these dimensions are utilised in order to ascertain how citizenship has been conceived on two levels of EU integrative politics. The first level is practices of policy- and law-making, starting with the founding treaties of the 1950s and ending with the post-Maastricht debates on Union citizenship. The second level is three instances of constitution-making importance within European integration: the Spinelli Project of the European Parliament, the Maastricht Process and the Convention on the Future of Europe. Methodologically, the analytical assessment of European citizenship discourse is provided on the basis of a process tracing exercise geared towards highlighting the crucial junctures of appearance, consolidation, and/or change with regard to the concept of citizenship. The main conclusion is that European citizenship discourse has created a conception of transnational citizenship, rather than postnational membership. This is visible on both empirical levels. The inherent transnationalism of European citizenship is found to have been initiated already in the founding ECSC and Rome Treaties. Citizenship elements in early European integration, such as free movement, market participation and, later, membership based on nationality in a Member State, created a frame upon which ensuing conceptions of citizenship developed. There were proposals for alternative conceptions based on a stronger notion of a more free-standing European status, for instance in elections to the EP, and more radical ideas of membership through dual European and national citizenship within constitution-making instances. Such proposals did, however, not significantly alter the conception of European citizenship as articulated around the border-crossing of Member State citizens. As much as this has highlighted - against the no demos view - that issues of citizenship are not incompatible with institution building and policy-making 'beyond the nation-state', it is also clear that one cannot detect a significant dissociation of citizenship and rights from nationality, as professed by postnationalists. Citizenship has evolved - mainly within policy practices - as a significant status of individuals within European integration through a transnational 'right to have rights' in second countries. Constitution-making instances have on the whole contributed to a consolidation of the basic tenets emanating from policy practices, rather than producing radical 'constitutional moments' of EU citizenship politics. The conceptual path of European citizenship discourse has, therefore, brought forward a conception based on a core principle of 'no rights without movement'; where elements such as political rights on the European and Member State levels, personhood as an additional condition for access to rights, and residence rights have been added as a consequence of evolving policies and practices of European integration."

Civil society promotion in post-communist Albania","2007","CHIODI, Luisa","Civil society -- Balkan Peninsula; Post-communism -- Albania","The thesis discusses whether the western aid policy of Civil Society Promotion (CSP) in postcommunist Albania constituted a policy of colonization with its direct penetration of the local public sphere or one of emancipation that pluralized the local and the international public spheres and created opportunities of transnational redistribution. It confronts the academic analysis of CSP with the debates emerged in the Albanian public sphere and looks at the reasons why the three different strands of denunciation of CSP as colonization identified (the problem of control, that of the technocracy and finally at the heuristic value of western categories) do not reflect the reception of the policy in the Albanian public sphere. The dissertation reconstructs the different phases of CSP&rsquo;s policy making in Albania and discusses why, after the initial welcoming of the policy, its outcomes in terms of growth of local NGOs have been widely considered unsatisfactory. What emerged from my inquiry was that the main criticism towards CSP that was raised in the Albanian public sphere was that its real beneficiaries turned out to be local NGO representatives themselves while society at large did not really benefit from the foreign support in the field due to its standardized way of dealing with the recipient&rsquo;s context. The thesis discusses the reformulation of the western policy making by local NGOs in connection to the post-communist troubled transformation. It confronts the different critiques to CSP with the efforts done by Albanian NGO to emerge and be recognized as civil society experts, civic innovators, and cultural mediators. The work concludes that CSP faces a circular problem: it requires a functioning local public sphere to be critically appropriated by the recipient public sphere but when it is mostly needed it is unlikely to work."

This dissertation focuses on the experience of Italian reproductive travellers who seek donor conception treatments outside national borders, as a reaction to Italian regulations on assisted reproduction banning gamete donation in Italy. Through the qualitative analysis of the narrations and practices of heterosexual couples, same-sex couples and single women, this work explores the ways in which people face different reproductive itineraries with the aim of achieving reproduction through donor conception in a context of law evasion. In particular, it takes into account the process that leads people to choose donor conception abroad and investigates the ways in which people make sense of this choice in relation to their understanding of kinship formation. The feelings that accompany this process, the concepts that people mobilise to make both law evasion and donor conception practice coherent with their reproductive goals, and the strategies that they employ to ""kin"" their donor-conceived children are presented and analysed. This study highlights the fact that Italian CBRC travellers who seek donation treatments abroad mainly consider their reproductive experience as a transgressive act, because by doing so they circumvent laws that forbid those treatments locally. They tend to support the moral validity of their choices by arguing that it aims to accomplish what they perceive as a ""normal"" goal (having a child). Nonetheless, the recourse to such a reproductive experience challenges existing cultural understandings and the social organisation of kinship."

The existing literature does not provide an answer if crossnational differences in social mobility levels are determined by socialist legacies or by the divergent paths these countries followed in their transition from socialist to capitalist system. In addition to the industrialisation thesis and the role of income inequality, I study the implications of political democracy and economic liberalisation for intergenerational status reproduction. Individual-level consequences of mobility are explored using the socialpsychological concept of the self-serving bias in causal attribution, which implies that people are more likely to explain individual success as resulting from their own abilities and efforts. Market-based democratic systems, almost by definition, emphasise the importance of selfdetermination in shaping an individual's life chances. Thus, upwardly mobile groups are expected to show greater support of unequal reward distribution. The hypotheses are tested using multivariate and multilevel statistical methods based on data from the European Values Studies and Life in Transition Survey. Although I find evidence of the decisive role of social origin in predicting educational and occupational attainment, particularly during postsocialism, cross-country variation in intergenerational social mobility can largely be explained by the institutions that were in place immediately after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. The findings suggest that while strong, positive links exist between social mobility and democracy levels in Western Europe, the economic liberalisation that took place in the early 1990s is the strongest predictor of why some post-socialist states have higher social mobility rates than others; subjective perceptions of mobility have stronger implications on attitudes than the objective mobility experience; upwardly mobile individuals do in fact demonstrate more support for inequality, democracy and market economy, but the strength of these links is mediated by macro-contextual variables."

I show how the desire to reap the benefits of nanotechnologies has led decision-makers in America and Europe to adopt very similar policy strategies. While political reactions thus are largely comparable, industry responses however differ remarkably. The diverging industry reactions to comparable state policies invite a closer inspection of the institutional drivers of business behavior in regulatory politics. I trace the roots of the varied business responses through two case studies that explore how the institutions and processes of national chemical control regimes link to the strategic risk-benefit calculations of companies. I examine the policies developed to regulate the risks of nanomaterials in Britain, Denmark, Germany and the United States and compare the role of industry in the four countries' regulatory processes. I argue that the capacity of state bureaucrats to credibly commit to regulatory outcomes shapes the political behavior of business. In areas of high scientific and technical uncertainty, such as nanotechnologies, new information can exercise significant influence on regulatory agendas, priorities and policies. This can work in industry's favor, if disclosing information succeeds in convincing state bureaucrats to make decisions that benefits industry. Companies will however only volunteer information about their operations if they are confident that it will not be used to the detriment of their interests. I demonstrate how concentration of regulatory powers in executive bureaucracies and deliberative institutions structure business expectations about the probable behavior of state authorities, and how such institutions can convince companies to entrust state bureaucrats with sensitive information. The thesis in short speaks to the significant business influence over the outcome of regulatory politics that flows from the power to disclose, bias and withhold information from state authorities."

Thus to find out more about the justificatory background of the reinvention of collective security after the end of the Cold War, an in-depth critical analysis is conducted of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) for the former Yugoslavia and the subsequent peacebuilding missions. Question are asked about whether in fact the problems of multidimensional peacekeeping are limited to bureaucratic and technical flaws that can be corrected through institutional and instrumental adjustments, or if they also relate to more fundamental normative problems of collective security in a global world. As such, the thesis has two main trajectories: collective human security and multidimensional peacekeeping. On the one hand, it addresses the relationship between security and world order, and on the other, the correlation between peace and collective security. By bringing security and peace studies together within a critical analytical framework that aims to inform theory through practice, divides between the discourse and the system of collective security are highlighted and connected with the practical problems of multidimensional peacekeeping and collective security in a global world. Three main sets of findings are made that indicate that multidimensional peacekeeping amounts to an institutionalization of internal conflicts that requires a practice of peace-as-global-governance that the UN is neither technically let alone normatively equipped to carry out. First, the policies of multidimensional peacekeeping have perverse consequences in practice whereby peacekeeping comes at the expense of peacebuilding. Second, in order to terminate multidimensional peacekeeping successfully, the UN is forced to compromise the initial aims of the operations to accommodate practice. Third, the aim of multidimensional peacekeeping is in the doing or in the ritual, rather than in the end result. Against this background, the argument is made that there are conceptual incoherencies between the practice and the system of collective security, which assumes that collective security is a sphere of influence in its own right that can tackle delicate normative dilemmas, both making and enforcing decisions about which processes and needs should be upheld and satisfied at the cost of others."

Labour Market Politics in Western Europe: Two Patterns of Reform","2011","DAVIDSSON, Johan",NA,"How can we understand labour market reforms in the era that has been described as governed by retrenchment and austerity? This thesis proposes that the patterns of reform that can be seen in Europe can be explained by the varying degrees of unions&rsquo; institutional power resources (IPRs). In the former period of expansion, unions could opt for maximalist solutions, but in the period of liberalisation and retrenchment they are forced to resort to secondbest solutions. To defend their power over the long term, their organisational interest, unions have had, on the one hand, to defend their own role in the deliberation and administration of policy reform, and on the other hand, to defend specific policies in which they have a vested interest (IPRs). This has meant that unions have agreed to deregulation and cutbacks, but only with regard to those policies which do not threaten to undermine their IPRs. Unfortunately, for labour market outsiders those policies have corresponded to policies that benefit insiders. Thus, in countries with strong IPRs, as in France and Sweden, we see dualist reform pattern whereas in countries with weak IPRs, as in the UK, we see a liberal reform pattern with general deregulation and cutbacks. This thesis makes three contributions to the literature. First, by looking at institutional power instead of traditional power resources (union density, socialdemocratic parties in government) we can see that unions in France, while having few members and low-level coordination capacities, in fact have been more powerful than unions in Sweden. Second, we see a dualist reform pattern also in Sweden, a country known for its universal welfare system and encompassing unions. Despite the more encompassing union structure, unions have opted for similar second-best solutions as in France. Third, there has been a debate in the literature about whether dualisation (dual reform) has a dynamic that makes it persistent over time or if it is rather a first step towards liberalisation (liberal reform). The thesis contributes to this debate by arguing that dualisation persists when and where there exist strong IPRs. In Sweden, we can see that in policy areas where IPRs are strong there has been dual reform (employment protection) and where IPRs have been undermined there has been an emerging trend towards liberal reform (unemployment insurance, active labour market policy). Thus, we have a counterfactual where IPRs exist in one policy area but not in others in the same country. The thesis also includes a negative case, the UK, where IPRs were never established."

Existing IR theories cannot fully answer these questions. In this thesis, I focus on Europe &ndash; the area in the world where armaments cooperation has been pursued more extensively. Drawing from the existing literature in international relations theory, in management studies and industrial organization, I make two claims. First, the stability of the post-Cold War era has generally given European countries &ndash; although to different extents &ndash; an incentive to gear their defense policies towards the protection of domestic jobs and the promotion of military export rather than towards capabilities development. Second, in order to achieve these goals, EU countries have strategically cooperated on the production of some specific weapon systems rather than others. By altering the structure of the market, and thus creating winners and losers, technological change can explain this variation. In my dissertation I show that European countries were more likely to pursue cooperation in armaments production when either an exogenous and relatively major technological change made their defense industries less competitive in export markets (architectural change)  or when extremely advanced components were necessary to compete in global armament markets (modular innovations). Conversely, European countries were less likely to cooperate when either an industry was characterized by linear improvements (evolutionary change) &ndash; and thus cooperation could only harm domestic industry and employment &ndash; or when a revolutionary innovation emerged (radical change). In this latter instance, each country had a strong interest in pursuing its own program so to create a domestic industrial base and, eventually, establish the industry&rsquo;s dominant design, thus becoming market leader. 2 I test my theory on three case studies.

It treats the issue at a normative and empirical level. The normative part is an analysis of four theoretical contributions to the discourse on EU democracy: the standard version of the democratic deficit, the regulatory state, multi-level governance and integration through deliberation. The empirical part explores the political use of the theories&rsquo; legitimacy claims in two cases: the European Parliament&rsquo;s inquiry into BSE and its debates relating to the Convention on the Future of Europe. The analysis reveals certain problems in theoretical and political discourse. Whereas the critique of the standard version has some merit, the positions formulating non-majoritarian notions of EU democracy are equally, if not more, problematic. The regulatory state, multilevel governance and integration through deliberation dress up old ideas &ndash; technocracy, interest group pluralism and constitutionalism respectively &ndash; and attempt to reinvest them with democratic legitimacy. The cases further illustrate the problem. For one thing, they indicate that the assumptions of the positions do not hold. What is more, non-majoritarian approaches to EU democracy, while allowing political actors to use the language of democracy, do not provide them with concrete proposals as to how existing structures might be democratised. The result is a discrepancy between the language of democracy, promising popular control and political equality, and the proposals for institutional and constitutional reforms, which tend to either discourage mass engagement or obscure how and in what capacity citizens are to participate. There is a tendency, I conclude, to confuse democracy with legitimacy, and legitimacy with consensus. As a result, the attempts at rearticulating EU democracy succeed neither in establishing a new basis for EU democracy, nor in identifying different or new forms of legitimacy. From this, three consequences derive: First, the democratic deficit should be regarded as structurally determined. Second, the persistence of the democratic deficit requires a thorough debate on the scope of EU competences. Finally, more attention should be devoted to the role of national and regional actors in European integration."
"http://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/22687","Using Historical Experience: The British Army and the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan","2012","SANGAR, Eric",NA,"This PhD explores some of the ways in which the British and German Armies have used historical experience in their process of operational adaptation in Afghanistan. Historical experience is conceptualized as a body of useful knowledge that is constructed through the institutional analyses of past military campaigns with the aim of producing normative lessons for military operations in the present. Empirically, the research shows that for both armies, the use of historical references played a limited role during the preparation of initial deployment for the ISAF mission. However, having become aware of a lack of operational coherence on the ground in Helmand, the British Army &ldquo;rediscovered&rdquo; the importance of applying fundamental counterinsurgency principles that were identified with a comparative analysis of colonial counterinsurgency campaigns. This process has contributed to improve officers&rsquo; consensual understanding of doctrine on the part of the officers as well as to make the British military approach in Afghanistan more coherently focused on protecting the population rather than pursuing a predominantly kinetic confrontation with the insurgency movement. With regards to the Bundeswehr, a thorough discussion of the historical experiences that have potential utility for military operations in Afghanistan has been largely absent. Initially, the German military approach was dominated primarily by an unconscious reliance on the operational design used in the Balkans. The operational reaction to the escalating violence in the Kunduz area has primarily consisted in a hesitant introduction of kinetic means, while existing deficits in non-kinetic military activities have largely been ignored. Similarly, operational debate among Bundeswehr officers has been focused on the necessity to perform in combat  implications of counterinsurgency operations for non-kinetic military tasks, such as the support of the local population, have received only marginal attention. I argue that this tendency could have been limited has an internal debate taken place on the historical lessons that incorporate the concepts used in contemporary Anglo-Saxon counterinsurgency. In sum, three primary findings of this research may be recapitulated as follows: First, the mere existence of a rich institutional past of colonial operations does not necessarily equate with superior knowledge in contemporary operations. Historical experience must be actively transmitted, analysed and institutionalised in order to have such an effect. Second, the ways in which military organizations use experience from the past are shaped by institutional traditions that have evolved over time. Third, despite the danger of dysfunctional historical analogies, the institutional discussion of historical lessons can prove to be useful for present operations &ndash; especially if consistency is promoted through consensually applied, &lsquo;enduring&rsquo; principles of doctrine."

According to me, utopia is both a form of discourse and a set of particular practices. Thus, to be called utopian, a discourse has to include, first, a rejection of the existing society, and second, if not a clear conception of what another world might look like, at least the idea that another society is possible and desirable. And, to be called utopian, practices need to be an attempt to create here and now at least some of the features of this utopian discourse, in the hope of a spread in the rest of society. This definition of utopia has been inscribed in a theoretical reflection linking the concept to the other explanatory dimensions of social movements in order to see how bringing utopia in the debate can highlight some neglected aspects of collective action. In order to investigate the presence and the impact of utopia, I have decided to conduct a comparative case study within a single social movement: political consumerism. I understand political consumerism as a social movement in which a network of individual and collective actors criticize and try to differentiate themselves from traditional consumerism by politicizing the act of buying in order to search for and promote other types of consumption. Thus I have observed four groups from two countries, France and the UK: two convivia of the Slow Food organization, a group of de-growth promoters surrounding the Casseurs de Pub and an intentional community living with the principles of ecovillages called Redfield Community. Through the study of these groups, I have been able to uncover the &ldquo;grammatical structure&rdquo; of their utopias and, then, the content of these utopias. Once this done, I have observed the interactions between utopian discourses and utopian practices. Individually, utopias, through these interactions, end up shaping the whole life of the activists and, collectively, they have consequences for many of the choices groups make. They constrain them so that they choose means that are consistent with their ends, but they also help them move beyond some of the difficulties the groups meet. These interactions also involve an emotional work that is both directed towards the activists themselves and towards outsiders. Finally, I have looked at the dialectical relationship that exists between utopia and the involvement people have in collective action. Activists use their utopias more or less consciously to have an impact on society, convince others of the rightness of their cause and protect themselves against attacks from others. Moreover, utopia has a role in the positioning of these groups in the spaces of social movements and politics."

A number of studies have investigated EU coordination systems and their determinants. By and large, existing studies find that EU coordination systems vary to a large extent because they are a function of pre-existing institutions and values characterising the political systems of each member state. However, these studies are not calibrated to single out exactly which national institutions matter most and many of them neglect national agency. In order to address this shortfall and advance our knowledge about EU coordination, a number of predictions are generated using the veto player approach. The predictions are assessed against empirical evidence from Germany and Denmark, which varies considerably in terms of the constellation of veto players. The two coordination systems are outlined, using process tracing, from three perspectives. First, a diachronic perspective is taken to analyse how coordination systems were established and have changed over time. This analysis shows that veto players play a prominent role in shaping coordination systems, as they utilise their veto powers to increase their influence when determining national negotiation positions. Second, a synchronic perspective is used to examine how coordination systems are organised at a specific point in time. The veto player approach performs well in explaining cross-country variation in the role of subnational units and national parliaments. Third, an applied perspective is used to analyse how EU coordination systems work de facto when establishing national negotiation positions for the draft Services Directive. This analysis indicates that veto players are important but there is not a straightforward correlation between their number and the effectiveness of the coordination systems."

The impact of voting advice applications on political behavior","2012","VASSIL, Kristjan",NA,"Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) proliferate across Europe and beyond. By matching the political offer with voters&rsquo; preferences, these internet applications assist voters in their decisions. However, despite the growing number of VAA users in several European polities, little is still known about the profile of a typical VAA user, let alone about the impact of VAA usage on individual level attitudes and behavior. Dominant research in this field offers contradictory evidence for it suffers from poor data quality, relies on descriptive analysis and fails to tap causality. To remedy these problems this thesis systematically investigates the patterns of VAA usage and its impact on voting preferences, vote choice and electoral turnout. In so doing I employ data from cross sectional election studies, panel surveys and a large N field experiment. First, I demonstrate that VAA usage is more frequent among the young, educated citizens from urban areas. However, additionally to these baseline properties, VAA users appear to be considerably more active in political life, they are interested in political issues and they are available to electoral competition. Second, using an experimental research design, I demonstrate that VAAs are more likely to affect the young and the less educated. Findings show that VAAs indeed influence users&rsquo; political preferences, vote choice and motivate voters to participate in elections. More specifically, VAAs help young voters to distinguish between political parties and the less educated are likely to change their vote choice as compared to the previously intended one as a consequence of VAA usage. Taken together, the findings confirm theories of political socialization and the life cycle effects by which one&rsquo;s susceptibility to political information slows down with advancing age. However, the patterns of usage and impact appear to cancel each other out, in that those who most frequently use VAAs are least likely to be affected by their vote advice. Conversely, among those groups where the impact appears to be greatest, the likelihood of VAA usage is lowest. By implication, while the VAA effects can be found on an individual level, the mechanism by which the influence is exercised prevents large changes at the aggregate level. Therefore, much like the boat sailing against the tide covers little distance over ground, VAAs do influence individual level attitudes and behavior, but fail to bring about aggregate change."

However, the unit of analysis is all but classical; on the contrary, this is something which is still an unusual presence within the discipline: the mass media. This research, indeed, aims at understanding if, how, and why the news international television networks (and CNN in particular) had power over the political and military decision-making during NATO&rsquo;s intervention in Kosovo and Operation Enduring Freedom. Having analysed the existing literature to clarify concepts and theories which explain media power during international conflicts, I advanced my criticisms and presented my hypotheses about media power, and its sources, in order to develop a theoretical framework on which I could ground the empirical part of the research. It has been clarified, therefore, that the international news networks have: a) Power over the political agenda; b) Power over the process (over timing of the decision making); c) Power over the selection of communication channels; d) Power over the choice of instruments. A complex set of different methods has been used, which leads to an essentially diagnostic case analysis. This is based on the examination of those processes which, through documentation and interpretation, would be considered as effects of media power. In particular, the presence of some different effects has been detected: Agenda Setting, Real Time Policy, Media Diplomacy, and what has been labelled Media War. Research methodology is a combination of qualitative methods of both data collection and analysis, varying for each supposed effect of media power. The most important data are transcripts from CNN, newspaper articles, press agency bulletins, memoirs, and texts of original interviews conducted with policy makers, journalists, and military officials. These texts have been considered both as sources of information and as text to be rigorously analysed through a particular method of text analysis, which is semiotics, in order show how meaning is constructed by different speakers."

The subject of this dissertation emerged from a paradox: Portugal reveals a noticeable capacity to incorporate pressures from European social policies soft mechanisms, but at the same time shows a consistent pattern of bad compliance when it comes to hard-law instruments. This pattern of asymmetrical compliance creates an appropriate setting to understand how on one hand the Europeanization process affects domestic policies, and on the other, which factors explain the variation in the levels of policy change from one sub-field of social policy to another via policy instruments with different convergence capacities. I claim that the reasons for compliance with Europe should be sought in domestic factors, namely in the combination of a conducive context created by a strong European legacy in domestic policies with the convergence between the European pressure and the domestic policy agenda in policy arenas whose characteristics facilitate policy change. I make the case that there is no dualism between a politicisation and a socialisation approach. In fact, even considering the predominance of politicisation mechanisms, I argue that when compliance occurs, both mechanisms are present. My argument is that responses to European pressures reflect not only the introduction of new incentive structures but also the creation of new patterns of social relations. This is particularly true for European social policies, an area where Europe has invested over time in the dissemination of ideational resources, alongside material incentives. I argue that those ideational resources have a delayed effect by formatting policy arenas and giving meaning to certain incentives, providing a social context whereby pressures are perceived both as costeffective and as legitimate. The corollary of this line of reasoning is that there is no relation between the a priori convergence capacity of European policy instruments (i.e. soft and hard-law) and their de facto effectiveness. In the cases analysed, the decisive factor for domestic compliance was the combination of ideational with political factors. Furthermore, I argued that the distinctive traits of each policy arena are central to understand the extent to which EU policy initiatives mobilise domestic coalitions, which prove decisive for the resistance of policy innovation."

On an empirical level, the thesis contrasts the EU discourse with an in-depth analysis of two (historic) cases of nature of the Union debates: that of the (early) United States and Canada. Empirically, a core insight of the study is that the puzzle regarding the nature of the EU is largely misunderstood as being an exceptional or sui generis case. Rather, a (temporary) &ldquo;state of limbo&rdquo; is found to be the rule and not the exception in the systems studied. In terms of its theoretical contribution, Dennis-Jonathan Mann&rsquo;s thesis seeks to overcome the positivistic (and often teleological) approaches prevailing in the field of comparative federalism by drawing upon insights from constructivist epistemology. Thereby, a positivist reliance on &ldquo;hard facts&rdquo;, strict typologies and formal institutions can be shifted towards a perspective that allows for an analysis of the debates and discourses about the systems&rsquo; alleged &ldquo;facts&rdquo; and structures. Hereby, Dennis-Jonathan Mann not only shows remarkable analogies between the three nature of the Union debates, the findings also raise questions over some of the core assumptions found in the European integration literature. Above all, the findings suggest that essentially contested federal systems can be sustained in spite of rivaling concepts regarding their nature and telos, thereby refuting widely held beliefs that the European Union must either &ldquo;clarify its nature&rdquo; or fail. Contrary to the latter view, the findings of this thesis actually suggest that&mdash;rather than endangering them&mdash;a contested nature and constitutional ambiguity is what holds these Unions together and what enables them to &ldquo;go on&rdquo;."

The thesis investigates the role of local organisations of the unemployed in contentious activities. More specifically, it looks at the forms of collective action these local organisations are engaged in, and asks about which conditions lead to the disruptive activities considered crucial for poor people&rsquo;s actors. This is done by analysing different empirical sources: semi-structured interviews, participant observation, surveys, and expert interviews. In order to describe the forms of contentious engagement seen and the role of local organisations, the second part employs an analytical descriptive approach. In an attempt to explain the tactical choices of organisations of the unemployed I link four different conditions (access to resources, access to the field of institutionalised actors, belonging to a counter-cultural network and movement experience) to the use of disruptive activities. Combining all four conditions I then carry out a Comparative Qualitative Analysis (QCA). One important insight of the thesis is that contentious action by the poor can be stabilised over time. Further, the thesis also shows that the two fields of local organisations are characterised by different features. Some features, for example the existence of certain types of organisations - as defined by their preferred activities - can be explained by the political system and, more particularly, by the institutions of contention present in each country. However, there are also many similarities between the fields, showing that national opportunity structures explain only some aspects of contentious action. In looking at the conditions leading to the use of disruptive action, the thesis shows that political opportunities are just one of several other factors that explain types of contentious engagement. The thesis disconfirms the assumption of the central role of exclusion from centres of political and discursive power and the lack of resources in accounting for disruptive action. It is more important that organisations of the unemployed belong to a counter-cultural network, defined as a necessary, albeit not a sufficient condition for disruptive action."

It took more than four years of atrocities before a peace agreement was finally negotiated in Dayton, Ohio, in November 1995. This book provides a detailed analysis of the response of Western Europe to the disintegration of Yugoslavia. The account pays particular attention to the behaviour of the major Member States of the European Community (later Union), such as France, Britain, and Germany, in two crucial moments of debate and decision-making: the diplomatic recognition of Slovenia and Croatia in 1991, and the debate on the desirability and form of a possible military intervention in the warring country. By combining three theoretical approaches to the study of international politics - neorealism, neoliberal institutionalism, and liberal intergovernmentalism - Lucarelli provides a theoretically informed analysis of the main forces behind Western Europe's response to the Yugoslav wars. Conclusions are drawn on the major characteristics of Western Europe's management of the conflict, the interplay of international and domestic factors behind the behaviour of Western European states, the relative explanatory power of each of the three theoretical perspectives and their common research tradition, and the perspective of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union. The book's reconstruction and evaluation of conflict management in ex-Yugoslavia, its attention to the influence of the European integration process on the foreign policy of its Member States, and its use and assessment of International Relations theoretical tools, should make it of topical interest for a wide range of scholars interested in both international and European political affairs."

What is the role of the classic urban-rural cleavage today? To answer these questions, the dissertation combines approaches from urban geography and political science to explain how the political preferences between core city and suburban voters differ in a cross-national comparative perspective. Suburbanisation has radically changed the European landscape in the 20th century: A significant share of the population now lives in places that could be defined as suburbs instead of inner cities, small towns and villages, or the countryside. However, when it comes to questions concerning the built environment and the political sphere, a large part of political research only distinguishes between urban and rural, even though metropolitan regions now include a multitude of different places with their own characteristics and associated political beliefs and interests. Urban-suburban divergences in political preference are examined considering the close relationship between the built environment and patterns of daily life. The dissertation incorporates the idea of the social construction of spaces into an explanation of suburban electoral preferences. The study demonstrates that urban-suburban divergences are substantially based on diverging patterns of daily use of spaces, as well as to different lifestyles within the middle class. Two key aspects are relevant: the family pattern and the use of public services. First, family patterns are clearly related to the building density of the place of residence. It is postulated that in less densely constructed and populated municipalities, the organisation of daily life is easier in a breadwinner-housekeeper pattern, which is in turn linked to conservative political preferences. Second, urban inhabitants tend to rely more on public services than suburbanites, while right-wing conservative parties tend to favour the limitation of public services. The hypotheses are examined in three country case studies (Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland) that begin with an overview of the national histories of suburbanisation, showing how suburbanisation and metropolitanisation are related to political discourses and policy-making. In a second step, statistical analyses take into account different aspects of suburban and urban inhabitants' daily life routine related to the use public services as well as to the family pattern. The findings of the statistical analyses are interpreted in relation to the history of suburbanisation and evidence that political preferences are indeed related to daily life and the place of residence. The analyses mostly result in a suburban tendency towards the conservative side of the political spectrum as compared to inner city inhabitants, and show that suburban political preference patterns are closer to rural than to core city patterns. In a further context, the study aims to broaden the understanding of political cleavages in European democracies, particularly the urban-rural cleavage, highlighting the relationship between one of the largest changes in the European landscape over the 20th century and the inhabitants' political preferences."

Similarly, among studies investigating the role of social capital and work experience for the choice of self-employment at the individual level, no space has been devoted to the young from these two country settings. This thesis fills such a gap and offers a comparative analysis of self-employment and entrepreneurship of the 20-35- year-olds in Poland and Ireland, conducted in 2005. It presents a comparison of motivations from a wide perspective of socio-economic context in which young entrepreneurs are embroiled. In addition, it provides analysis of social capital, work experience, institutional environment for business, and the ways of dealing with business management aspects. Yet, important input to the literature proposed by this study regards motivations to continue which evolve from the motivation for start over time when staying in business. To tackle such queries, in-depth qualitative and exploratory interviews with 40 entrepreneurs (20 in Warsaw and 20 in Dublin) were conducted. The thesis reveals that motivations do not have an association with unemployment in the Polish case and are dependent on economic growth in the Irish case. In both instances, this may be linked to the educational (human) and occupational capital, potentially increasing the likelihood of treating firm as a chance or an opportunity. Some of the motivational factors which are common to these two contexts are: desire to work for oneself, money, and dissatisfaction with work. Social capital conceived as weak and strong social ties proved to be an important factor accounting for the decision to move into self-employment and stay in it. The major differences were traced with respect to strategies and institutional assistance for entrepreneurship. The thesis may inform individual characteristics of entrepreneurship in the countries concerned. In addition, it appears as an initial step for testing the results obtained on bigger sample studies. It also formulates some tentative recommendations which may offer timely insights for decision-makers responsible for the promotion of entrepreneurship."

Organisational dynamics and trajectories of feminist organisations in Milan and Berlin","2010","DEL GIORGIO, Elena","Feminism -- Berlin; Feminism -- Italy; Feminism","Although beginning from the more general question 'What has happened to the women&rsquo;s movement?', the more precise research questions this thesis addresses are: 'how and why do feminist organisations style their organisations in the way they do?', and 'what are the dynamics that guide organisational transformation and change?'. In order to answer these questions, the thesis relies on the theoretical tools provided by social movement research. More specifically, it refers to the emerging branch of literature called the 'cognate area', in which concepts borrowed from traditional approaches to social movements are revisited and combined in order to take into account the effects of cultural and structural, interpretative and material factors in triggering, shaping and transforming mobilization. Such an approach was chosen because it allows the researcher to better consider the great variety of organisational forms which marks women&rsquo;s movement organisations which has in turn, in some respects, made it an 'awkward' movement to study for scholars of social movements. Methodologically, the thesis takes a comparative approach to investigating the trajectory of the women&rsquo;s movement in two countries: Germany and Italy. Considering that feminist activism is traditionally rooted at the local level, the empirical research focuses, through the triangulation of interviews, participant observation and document analysis, on two urban contexts: Berlin and Milan. The thesis recognizes the great importance of past organisational experiences for WMOs. Accordingly, following two chapters dedicated respectively to theoretical approaches and the definition of the women&rsquo;s movement and WMOs, as well as methodology, the third chapter of the thesis describes in detail the path of WMOs in the two cities - from the 1960s until 2000. The final part of the chapter highlights historical similarities and differences. Finally, the last two chapters and the conclusions focus on the empirical research, showing how different political opportunity structures, traditions of mobilization, organizational repertoires, material opportunities and ideological legacies all concurred in shaping different 'multiorganisational fields' on women's issues and thus different organisational choices for single WMOs. The greater dependence of Berlin WMOs on public funding, their greater degree of professionalization and formalization, as well as their greater isolation from potential political allies are all factors that largely influence their goals and functioning. In Milan organizations are conditioned by a lower level of professionalization, relative financial independence, the presence of double militants who act as bridges with other political organisations in the broader area of the Left, and by a greater reliance on (different) feminist theoretical approaches in choosing and organizing goals and activities."

It is argued in this dissertation that an important variable has been missed in the literature, namely, citizens&rsquo; cognitive support for democracy. By including this concept in the analysis of Europeans&rsquo; support for democracy, a number of aspects which had been much uncertain until now are inspected. First, conceptual clarification of support for democracy is possible, by distinguishing different types of orientations to democracy. Second, and from an empirical perspective, classical indicators of support for democracy are examined, in order to assess for validity. Interesting results have emerged from the analysis: 1. Determining the structure and the levels of affective support for democracy in Europe. The classic churchillian indicator (&lsquo;democracy best&rsquo;) overstates levels of affective support for democracy in Europe. The structure of affective support for democracy is in fact not homogeneous across Europe, but differs substantially from one group of countries to the others. 2. Mapping types of democrats across Europe. There are different types of democrats across Europe, depending on their cognitive orientations to democracy. These are not evenly spread within each country, but there is correspondence between the structure and levels of affective support and the predominant type of democrats in a country. 3. Studying why people are dis-satisfied with democracy in Europe. The congruence hypothesis (are citizens&rsquo; orientations to democracy meaningfully related among them?) is tested. Most citizens are indeed fairly congruent: cognitive and affective supports have an impact on the evaluations of their democratic systems. As such, not only is it possible to determine some of the causes of dis-satisfaction with democracy, but also to claim that the indicator of satisfaction with democracy does reasonably well as a measure of general support for the performance of the regime."

Although the choice of issues that parties make can, to a great extent, be explained by several well-established theories (e.g. ownership, median voter), in recent decades the patterns of party issue competition in European democracies have become more complex. Current theories fall short of explaining fully why parties choose to compete over certain issues but not others, and what motivates them to follow issue strategies that either converge or diverge from that of their competitors. Approaching this question from the perspective of polity vs. policy issue competition, this thesis aims to identify the factors that increase the salience of polity issues and shape the patterns of convergence and divergence on polity/policy issue competition. I argue that institutional factors, such as party system competitiveness and left/right polarisation, along with dominant cultural values, the state of the economy, and a party's position within the given party system all influence political parties' behavior in polity/policy issue competition. In order to test this hypothesis, I have conducted quantitative panel-data analysis (with the random effects and fixed effects models for the sample of 18 Western European countries between 1979 and 2013) and produced five case studies (pre-election campaigns in the United Kingdom in 1979, 1997 and 2010, and in Italy in 1979 and 2008).  The results of this study suggest that, as predicted, in more competitive and polarised (along the left/right axis) party systems, political parties tend to emphasise polity-type issues, as well as to diverge more sharply on polity/policy issue competition. Equally strong results also appeared for the factor of the party's position within the relevant party system &ndash; minor and non-governing parties compete over polity issues more fiercely than their counterparts in power. Finally, while economic factors proved likely to be the key driving force for the salience of polity issues in party competition, the results did not indicate that dominant cultural values produced any effect on polity/policy issue competition."

Assessing the Age Gap in Voter Turnout Between Younger and Older Citizens","2010","SMETS, Kaat","Voting -- Great Britain; Voting -- Behavior -- Great Britain; Elections -- Great Britain","This thesis departs from the observation that in some countries such as Canada the age gap in voter turnout between younger and older citizens is widening. It does so because of a rapid turnout decline among the youngest electoral cohorts. These findings prompt the following question: What are trends in the age gap in voter turnout between younger and older citizens in other Western democracies, and how can these trends be accounted for? Plotting over-time age differences for ten countries, this thesis shows that age patterns in voter turnout are far from generic. Evidence of a widening generational divide is found in Canada, Denmark, Great Britain, Norway, and the United States. The age gap in Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden, on the hand, turns out to be relatively stable or even trendless through time. Turning from description to explanation, this thesis presents a novel hypothesis to account for declining turnout levels among young voters. Combining the life-cycle and cohort/generation approaches to age differences in political participation, the later maturation hypothesis examines the idea that the timing of certain life-cycle events that are considered important for the development of political participation varies from one generation to the next. Since key events such as leaving school, starting a first job, getting married and starting a family nowadays take place at a higher average age than they used to, later maturation should be able to explain turnout decline among young voters at least partially. Based on data from the British Election Studies from 1964 to 2005, this thesis shows that delays in the timing of life-cycle events are indeed negatively related to individual level youth voter turnout. Attendance of religious services, levels of political interest, turnout at previous elections, perceived party differences and strength of party identification also explain over-time differences in youth voter turnout. The largest share of individual level youth turnout is, however, accounted for by turnout trends in the rest of the electorate. At the aggregate level later maturation is also shown to explain part of the widening of the age gap. The political-institutional context, however, explains between-country differences best."

Then, on the other hand, I tried to assess if and how far rule adoption has been motivated by internalized, socially constructed identities, values and norms. The analysis has shown that there are interesting cases of Europeanisation not only in Ukraine, but also in Russia, allowing me to highlight the limits deriving from the use of conditionality in the new neighborhood and the need to reconsider the mix between different Europeanisation strategies."

The interest representation of states and their sub-state entities in the European Union","2010","TATHAM, Michael Robert","Regionalism -- European Union countries; Central-local government relations -- European Union countries","Much research has highlighted that sub-state entities (SSEs) - such as the German L&auml;nder, Spanish autonomous communities or French regions - mobilise at the European level. This literature, however, suffers from a research gap on the question of how this sub-state activity interacts with that of its own member state. In other words, while it is clear that SSEs do represent their interests in Brussels, it is not so clear whether this activity is carried out with their member state (cooperation), without their member state (non-interaction) or against their member state (conflict). This thesis fills such a research gap by 1) identifying what the pattern of interaction between state and sub-state EU interest representation corresponds to and by 2) identifying what the determinants of such a pattern are. To achieve this double task, quantitative and qualitative methods are employed. The quantitative section consists of regression analysis on data collected through a survey addressed to the Heads of regional offices in Brussels (n=104). It highlights that cooperation is the most frequent outcome, followed by noninteraction. Conflicting interest representation is the least frequent outcome. It also indicates that, contrary to expectations, devolution levels do not affect conflict but increase the frequency of cooperation and decrease that of non-interaction. Meanwhile, party political incongruence fails to affect conflict, decreases cooperation and increases non-interaction. Finally, preference intensity configurations affect all three outcomes. This quantitative work was complemented by a series of in-depth case study analyses of Scotland (UK), Salzburg (Austria), Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes and Alsace (both France). Based on over a hundred semi-structured interviews with state, sub-state and supra-state officials and politicians, these case studies confirmed the overall findings reached through quantitative means and further suggested that the effect of devolution overrides that of party political incongruence. Additional statistical testing confirmed this inductive finding. The concluding sections highlight this research&rsquo;s overall theoretical and policy implications."

Women of younger generations are much more likely than their mothers and grandmothers to enter the labour market and stay in it after they marry and have children. Are these changes due only to changes in women's investments and preferences, or also to the opportunities and constraints within which women form their choices? Have women with higher and lower educational and occupational profiles combined family responsibilities with paid work differently? And have their divisions changed? With an innovative approach, this dissertation compares Italy and Great Britain, investigating transformations in women's transitions in and out of paid work across four subsequent birth cohorts, from the time they leave full-time education up to their 40s. It provides a comprehensive discussion of demographic, economic and sociological theories and contains large amounts of information on changes over time in the two countries, both in women's work histories and in the economic, institutional and cultural context in which they are embedded. By comparing across both space and time, the book makes it possible to see how different institutional and normative configurations shape women's life courses, contributing to help or hinder the work-family reconciliation and to reduce or reinforce inequalities. Women in and Out of Paid Work will be valuable reading for students, academics, professionals, policy makers and anyone interested in women's studies, work-family reconciliation, gender and class inequalities, social policy and sociology."

The meaning of locality and distance for Finnish professionals in Silicon Valley","2010","KIRIAKOS, Carol Marie","Geographical perception -- Finland; Labor mobility -- Finland -- 21st century; Labor mobility -- Social aspects; Human geography -- Finland -- 21st century","The study explores the meaning of locality and distance in the global world. Prominent social theorizations have declared locality and distance dead in the global era, which is characterized by the widespread use of virtual communication. Yet diverse empirical studies on transnational skilled mobility, global brain circulation, and innovation and knowledge transfer show that locality and distance still matter. I argue that grand theorizations would benefit from empirically grounded research, while empirical studies would gain from explicit, systematic studies on the issue of the presumed demise of distance and locality. The present study aims towards filling this gap with an empirically grounded approach close to real-life meanings and experiences. The empirical questions focus on two issues: 1) personal motivations and identities in relation to place and 2) everyday work and knowledge sharing both locally and at distance. The approach is qualitative and inductive with ethnographic features; the main data are in-depth interviews with Finnish professionals in Silicon Valley. Highly skilled Finns in Silicon Valley represent a case of West-West mobility; from one successful Western location to another. Skilled professionals are an interesting case for the investigation of the meaning of locality and distance, because according to many authors more privileged people in particular are presumed to be detached from localities and free from the realities and constraints of distance. The findings show that locality and distance are still very much alive from both personal and work perspectives. Firstly, the relationship between personal motivations/identities and place is a two-way one: locations can be seen as targets or ways to fulfill personal or professional dreams, achieve goals, or challenge and develop as a person. Changing locations also evokes new identities, such as the pioneer or the mediator, which are counterintuitive considering the presumed death of distance. Secondly, the dynamics of locality and distance are present in everyday work, which is structured across several time zones, not only the local one. Virtual communication has therefore changed the organization of work locally, but has not erased distance or rendered locality less significant. In contrast, the awareness of distance is emphasized in virtual communication. Physical distance and differences of context (time of day, weather, cultural environment) can pose challenges in reaching mutual understandings or making joint decisions. Furthermore, being present in a locality and experiencing face-to-face interaction becomes even more meaningful in the form of chance encounters, taking collaboration to the next level, accessing certain types of information and knowledge, and inspiration (the experience of ""being at the center of things""). Furthermore, the findings indicate that certain kinds of information and tacit knowledge do not travel well across distance and that local presence is needed to access these. The meaning of locality for these professionals can be summarized as three I?s: Information, Interaction and Inspiration. Finally, I will consider the idea of the death of locality and distance and what has actually changed and what has not when it comes to their current meanings, on a more interpretive level."

Negotiated trade policy instruments create incentives for sector-wide interest representation, while administrative instruments elicit interest aggregation on a more product-specific, intra-sectoral level. I provide a rationale why reciprocal trade negotiations foster sector-wide associations, whereas trade rule enforcement elicits intra-sectoral coalitions. In contrast to existing explanations, these propositions can account for coalition patterns during both the GATT 1947, which consisted of a series of trade negotiation rounds, and the WTO (1995-), which combines negotiations with binding administrative enforcement in the form of international dispute settlement. Comprehensive evidence from EU trade policy lobbying confirms the explanatory force of the hypotheses. Sectoral peak associations co-ordinate interest representation during the GATT and WTO Rounds, whereas private interests predominantly organise on an intra-sectoral level when filing petitions for enforcement instruments administered by the European Commission. Exhaustive databases provide evidence about the predominantly intra-sectoral trade associations that lodge complaints with administrative instruments such as Anti-Dumping, market access investigations and WTO dispute settlement, while other sources reveal how sector-wide peak associations organise during negotiation Rounds. I provide supportive evidence from existing research on interest representation in American trade policy, and control for other factors such as industry concentration and non-trade regulation. The shift from negotiations-only to enforcement is further significant for interest representation in four selected sectors of European industry: chemicals, pharmaceuticals, steel and textiles. Although each of these industries has a long history of sector coherence, they all reorganised their membership and representation structure to accommodate for the increased importance of enforcement instruments. The adoption of direct company membership and/or the inclusion of product-specific trade associations accompany the decrease in importance of the sectorwide peak association in a world where the provision of detailed information for judicial enforcement is starting to weigh more than the political clout of sector-wide peak associations during negotiations."
